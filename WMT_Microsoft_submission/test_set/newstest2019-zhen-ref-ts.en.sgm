<seg id="1">According to the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that even though the US Navy was reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy -- the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the reports from the site of "Jane's Defence Weekly" on September 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Then, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was reported that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts. They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama administration.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Admiral William Moran said that the focus of the US Navy would still focus on the West Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the round-table discussion, which was hosted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant changes. "</seg>
<seg id="7">Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it. "</seg>
<seg id="8">But he admitted that the United States kept close relations with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. "</seg>
<seg id="10">Although he pointed out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians might face the demographic and economic challenges, but the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Admiral Moran said that as a part of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a "new campaign mode". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or other assets at any specified time and place.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictable battle. We should not show up at the same place again and again like clockwork. -- This is our approach. "</seg>
<seg id="13">It was reported that the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies to know that these warships would still patrol in the traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in this event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group.</seg>

<seg id="1">People’s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R&D and related protection work, and deeply explore the potential value of patents to occupy the market domination.</seg>
<seg id="2">Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous infringements crisis in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator, Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff’s patent.</seg>
<seg id="5">On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three plaintiffs believe that they are the patentees and inventors of the "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole operation process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, during the court’s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in this case.</seg>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the infringement of this case was not in Guangdong.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved in the case was completely implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the defendant Guangdong Pacific’s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.</seg>
<seg id="12">The defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate evidence. The Court dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.’s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case.</seg>
<seg id="13">At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive Interview with CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results</seg>
<seg id="2">"China’s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientific field. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the China News Service in Beijing, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world famous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="5">CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation. ", Marshall said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In May of this year, China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China’s Eye of Heaven, installed the world’s first 19-beam L-band receiver.</seg>
<seg id="8">This internationally most advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.</seg>
<seg id="9">Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s many years of technical accumulation. When enabled, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientific observation targets will be expanded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is the contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Marshall said that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the "One Belt One Road".</seg>
<seg id="20">"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="2">Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very kind actions" during the last year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies</seg>
<seg id="3">"However, we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"If the United States doesn’t trust on us, we have no confidence in our national security. It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons under such circumstances. "</seg>
<seg id="5">Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="7">North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">The United States also refused to loose the requirements for the international sanctions on North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘declaration of the end of the war’," Ri Yong Ho said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The thought that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who don't know us.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this week at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, he emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked.

<seg id="1">Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition. Serbian President and Russian President will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="3">On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still effective. Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe and other sides about the current situation, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">When he was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. "</seg>
<seg id="7">Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict. However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness condition in connection with the two actions in Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.</seg>
<seg id="11">Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby. These areas were originally under the control of Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="12">Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make this military adventure. Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="13">Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western countries for their false words on the Kosovo issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">The source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country here in the 12th century. However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors. Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times.</seg>
<seg id="18">The subjective political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Albanian people in Kosovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey. The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising. The actions of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people. The contradiction between the two nations intensified.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balkan.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thereafter, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, which was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo. It exposed the conflict between the two nations again.</seg>

<seg id="1">China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li) -- A cloudless blue sky in the day and the red clouds at evening......Recently, Beijing kept in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky. Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tactics to show their pictures on social platforms and constantly make status updates to show their happinesses. They said that "the most beautiful skyline with a blue sky and white clouds was the best business card of Beijing".</seg>
<seg id="2">Beijing had met the "bluest sky" since August.</seg>
<seg id="3">It could be found anywhere in Beijing at any time that many residents were holding their smart phones or DSLR cameras to take pictures.</seg>
<seg id="4">On social platforms, such as the microblog and WeChat Moments, people could see the different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An Men, the Bird's Nest, Hutong, and various buildings against the blue sky in the net friends' cameras.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some net friends said that such "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Beijing; and some net friends joked that if the blue sky remain the same for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some net friends even hoped that "the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".</seg>
<seg id="6">Why did the residents in Beijing particularly like to show the blue sky?</seg>
<seg id="7">That's because they had been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past. They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly. After starting the "Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less fog and haze, but more blue skies. The residents were joyful to see this. And they felt so happy with it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather was fine in Beijing on National Day.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in green at 8:00 am, indicating the "Superior First Grade".</seg>
<seg id="10">The photography competition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the residents on social platforms was still under way.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why was the sky so blue in Beijing recently?</seg>
<seg id="12">As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period in history of the recent five years.</seg>
<seg id="13">The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.</seg>
<seg id="14">The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent days. And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control. It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region. These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.</seg>
<seg id="15">Beijing released officially and implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing" in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions. 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminated in total.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source. According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced the delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing. The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare. Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, but not the leading role.</seg>

Though the crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the "six unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website.</seg>
<seg id="9">Specifically, "unlicensed ticket provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed website" is the illegal website providing fake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour guide" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed car" is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed tour guide" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger service to illegal "one-day tour", and last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is "tourist trap".</seg>

<seg id="13">Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key "one-day tour" routes, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention and physical prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Tourist trap" during traveling has become a key focus due to its small number and operation in locality.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to strengthen the shock and attack on illegal "one-day tour", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation of laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day tour", and discussed means and methods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing "one-day tour" and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tour". The specific plan is still under study.</seg>

<seg id="1">After aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation is 98% in China, which has reached the level of developed countries.</seg>
<seg id="2">ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yanqian) -- Children's National Medical Center and Children's Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China".</seg>
<seg id="3">The project result showed that after aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation was 98% in China, which had reached the level of developed countries. However, the survival rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and the survival rate of premature infants without complications still needed to be improved greatly.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly lower than the national average level and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has significantly improved the survival quality of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the complication rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants. It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of cases of premature infants of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and has contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birth weight through four years of unremitting efforts. At the same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival quality of premature infants has been greatly improved.</seg>
<seg id="9">This project has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal care by setting up the national collaboration network of national quality improvement, introducing the concepts of collaborative quality improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.</seg>
<seg id="10">Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is reported that in the "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", the pediatric hospitals has introduced the EPIQ methods into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order to solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections in China NICU.</seg>
<seg id="12">After more than 10 years of constant improvement, the survival rate of premature infants without complications in Canada has increased by about 1/3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis in premature infants in the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">The EPIQ methods have been widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have been adopted by 6 other countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China.</seg>
<seg id="16">At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions in China.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as an important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center. This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and many other western provinces, with the goal of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is reported that Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been revealed that the coordination center's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will unite 63 hospitals across China to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in 2019, with the goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wu Jinglei, the director of Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, says that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia center.

<seg id="1">Xin Shiping: Build the "monument of heroes" in the heart - written on the fifth Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="2">On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Memorial Day. Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders came to the Tian'anmen Square to attend the ceremony for presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.</seg>
<seg id="3">At this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever you are.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Memorial Day is not only for reviving, but also for awakening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Look back the rich history, every martyr’s name represents a fresh life.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also have fiery youth, sincere love and caring families.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, for the belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for the purpose to "spare the suffering of the next generation", they are willing to sacrifice everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I would cry for China in each day of my life".</seg>
<seg id="9">Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to guide the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Where do you come from and where do you go?"; "What kind of man you want to be?"; It's not hard to have the answers if you understand the heroes.</seg>
<seg id="11">In memory of heroes, the most important thing is to build a "monument of heroes" in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and prosperity of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">Due to various reasons, many martyrs don’t even leave their names.</seg>
<seg id="14">Countless heroes and martyrs enrich ideals with blood, practice faith with life. To remember their names and inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root and soul.</seg>
<seg id="15">This "monument of heroes" cannot be stained or damaged.</seg>
<seg id="16">For some time, the historical nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emerge.</seg>
<seg id="17">All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgments, and cause the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.</seg>
<seg id="18">Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="19">We cannot let actions that touch the bottom line drift. We must dare to show our sword and uphold the dignity of heroes with rule of law and justice.</seg>
<seg id="20">On May 1, the law for the protection of heroes and martyrs came into force.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.</seg>
<seg id="22">A nation with pursuits cannot live without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot live without pioneers.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has become a common social consensus to recall the martyrs and call for heroes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds in China, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery every year.</seg>
<seg id="25">The hearts of the people are the strongest footstones.</seg>
<seg id="26">Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the national blood. The "monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan. But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.</seg>
<seg id="2">The aim of Italian Eurosceptic government was that the budget deficit was equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there was no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moscovici, the executive committee member of economic affairs of the European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," he responded cautiously since the proposals and sanctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The officials and diplomats of the European Commission still hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy officially submitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European Commission might veto the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dombrowski, the Vice-President of the European Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention", which was referred to the EU fiscal provisions.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he did not mention how this would trigger a response of the EU.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nearly 1,000 national scenic spots have cut ticket prices and the decreasing amplitude of more than half of them is over 20%</seg>
<seg id="2">[Abstract] As of September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or issued a document to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). The prices have been reduced in the scenic spots in Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="3">In order to implement the deployment of the decision of the Central Economic Working Conference and the Government Work Report, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Formation Mechanism of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Spots and Reducing Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Spots (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, requiring to improve the formation mechanism of ticket prices in state-owned scenic spots in terms of reasonable definition of the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovative price management methods and strict implementation pricing procedures, to ensure to achieve remarkable results for reducing the relatively high ticket prices in key state-owned scenic spots by the end of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">Various regions have actively carried out work according to the deployment requirements and reduced a batch of key state-owned scenic spot ticket prices.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or issued a document to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, there are 159 5A scenic spots and 534 4A scenic spots, with a total of 693 and accounting for 70.6%.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among 907 scenic spots which have reduced prices, the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of more than 20% is 491, accounting for 54.3% and the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of more than 30% is 214, accounting for 23.6%.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have a relatively large number of price reduction scenic spots, of which the number of price reduction scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, with an overall decreasing amplitude of more than 30%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The governments of Anhui, Chongqing and other six provinces (districts or cities) have all reduced prices for 5A scenic spots.</seg>

<seg id="10">The ticket prices of key state-owned scenic spots are gradual returning to the reasonable range, which is conducive to promoting the tourism industry to accelerate the transformation and upgrading from ticket economy to industrial economy, from minority tourism to mass tourism and from scenic spot tourism to all-for-one tourism, as well as conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimization of the supply structure of tourism industry and steady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The National Development and Reform Commission also emphasizes that various regions should strengthen the regulation of price order in scenic spots, guide scenic spots to improve their services, and ensure to reduce prices without reducing quality.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, for the problems that the decreasing amplitude of ticket prices in some scenic spots is too small and so-called reduction but no practical reduction recently reported by the media, the National Development and Reform Commission has made a special inspection to require various regions to seriously solve the problems, timely respond to the social concerns, and effectively implement price reductions.</seg>

<seg id="6">"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "</seg>
<seg id="7">Yu Shuxun described, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.</seg>
<seg id="8">Xinjiang is China’s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.</seg>
<seg id="11">Use film-free cotton for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.</seg>
<seg id="12">With the increasing amount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount of broken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.</seg>
<seg id="17">On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="18">In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to implement the "Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, adding "advantages" to Xinjiang’s agricultural green development.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upland cotton "Chinese Cotton 619".</seg>
<seg id="20">" ‘Chinese Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "</seg>
<seg id="21">At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="22">Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. "</seg>
<seg id="25">Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The support of cotton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="27">Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wang Yi, the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister made a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations on Friday, and said that currently, the China-U.S. relation came to a crossroad again. If both sides can actively treat each other with tolerance, expand and deepen the positive cooperation, and properly control differences and contradictions, they can open up a better prospect.</seg>
<seg id="2">"The China-U.S. relation is our common asset which needs us to care about together. "</seg>
<seg id="3">He said that it was expected that people of insight from all sectors of both countries took practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of the China-U.S. relation and jointly drove the China-U.S. relation to move forward in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wang Yi also emphasized again that China was certain to take a development road different from that of the traditional great powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This road with Chinese characteristics determined that China would not or can not repeat the mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United States, or challenge the United States, or even replace the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wang Yi made a speech with the topic of "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent" and said that currently, the profound crux of the problem is that some American friends believed that China would also make a mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. "</seg>
<seg id="8">He said that this self-imagined suspicion was spreading, and had amplified the existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for peaceful development.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chinese people have never had a gene for expansion.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was believed that all countries can live in harmony, and make exchanges and mutual learning.</seg>
<seg id="12">Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries to copy China's practices.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chinese side was always committed to developing the long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper of "The Facts and China’s Position on China-US Trade Friction".</seg>

<seg id="2">We'd like to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "</seg>
<seg id="3">In the morning of October 1, Mr and Mrs Song, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first train of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link for National Day, accepted an interview of a reporter from China News at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquired such information.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the morning of October 1, in order to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.</seg>

<seg id="6">At the very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="7">The reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that the National Day holiday was a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony. She felt very happy and excited to be able to accomplish this will on National Day.</seg>
<seg id="9">But currently, the flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. Thanks to the opening of the high-speed railway for the Hong Kong segment. Mr Song checked the train schedule and found that the first train could arrive at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Golden Bauhinia Square.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.</seg>
<seg id="2">University of Pretoria announced: "They are the first lions in the history, which are born by artificial insemination -- the first pair of lions in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of female African lions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion. They were pretty healthy and quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the intensive tests in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ganswindt said in a media interview: "We collected the sperms from a healthy male lion. "</seg>
<seg id="7">Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the female lion to reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, the result turned out to be successful. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the researchers "tried many times, but to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".</seg>
<seg id="10">He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Union for Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.</seg>

<seg id="1">The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said that although the trade tension between China and the United States rose, the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong.</seg>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the average daily exports of South Korea increased last month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, the initial value data released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase.</seg>
<seg id="4">The year-on-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, which was more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys.</seg>
<seg id="5">The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in September was $50.6 billion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the China-US trade disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the sales of oil products declined, Korean exports to America decreased by 11.8%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the market worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean memory chips and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean exports considerably depend on American and Chinese markets. "</seg>
<seg id="10">The imports decreased by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reuters survey.</seg>
<seg id="11">The initial value of trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Department of Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports.</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement pointed out, "the increasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be beneficial to the exports in the second half of this year. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifies, which are both negative pressure on exports. "</seg>
<seg id="15">The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Korean exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ignore the Threat of America!</seg>
<seg id="2">EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran</seg>
<seg id="3">The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the American allies did not seem to take the advice.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil with EU.</seg>
<seg id="6">The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or domestic currency.</seg>
<seg id="7">The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</seg>
<seg id="9">The US media said that in the one hour interview , Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. "</seg>
<seg id="13">However, she also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="14">In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="16">This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.</seg>
<seg id="17">Companies such as Airbus S.A.S. and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="18">British and French officials said, the US government may "take the lead".</seg>
<seg id="19">Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iran oil.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both Zarif and Iran President Rouhani believed that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Iran’s breach of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="22">Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of consideration. When asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that the prevalence of malnutrition in our children and adolescents had reduced but the prevalence of overweight-obesity had significantly increased comparing to decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="2">The expert pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease". The scientific fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the "Core Information on Health Education of Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released by the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was the rational diet and scientific movement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction were harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id="5">The health hazard behind the "chubby children" couldn't be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children.</seg>
<seg id="7">And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolescents' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ding Gangqiang said that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years old according to the Nutrition and Health Status Inspection of Chinese Residents in 2010-2012. The sum of these two rates was 16%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the characteristics of overweight-obesity among children and adolescents were that the overweight-obesity rate was higher in boys than in girls, and it was higher in cities than in villages. The overweight-obesity rate had significantly increased in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="10">How would the adolescents deal with the overweight-obesity?</seg>
<seg id="11">Zhang Li, the deputy director of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of General Administration of Sport of China, indicated that the primary causes of adolescent obesity at present were excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control.</seg>
<seg id="13">Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease", and an integral part of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness.</seg>
<seg id="14">The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height and weight, so that the problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures in time.</seg>
<seg id="15">For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and lose weight in addition to the active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage. They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight.</seg>

<seg id="1">China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported by Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) -- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation" (hereinafter referred to as "Scheduling Regulation") was officially enforced starting from October 1. After two years of navigation test, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially scheduled together with the navigation lock in a unified way.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the first day of enforcing the new regulations, the navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check.</seg>
<seg id="4">The navigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the enforcement of new regulations, the plan of security check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Classification Control" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lift respectively. The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region to be ranked in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the "navigation scheduling management waters" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters close to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Bridge in the "Scheduling Regulation". And the "core waters", "water close to dam", "control waters" and "scheduling waters" were divided.</seg>
<seg id="10">This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.</seg>
<seg id="11">The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="12">After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition of the reservoir area was improved, accelerating the rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.</seg>
<seg id="14">During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chen Dongyuan, the deputy director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" played an active role in promoting the management of crossing lock in an honest way, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region, and improving the navigation capacity.</seg>

<seg id="6">Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people’s government shall be subject to post-site inspection. After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the production license can be obtained after passing the formal examination, and then the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="7">Third, for enterprises produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license", when apply for a new license or apply for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, implement the responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production license for false promises and non-compliance.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in principle should be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.</seg>
<seg id="11">Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification and promote brand building and market expansion.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is necessary to benchmark the international advanced standards and promote the quality of industrial products.</seg>
<seg id="13">Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.</seg>
<seg id="14">For products that retain industrial product production license administration, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervise", dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, timely reduce catalogues, delegate approval authority or convert to certification administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, he said that due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the effect of low interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking system could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Although these risks are not too big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The minutes released by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed that the policy committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate meeting in September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The minutes showed that a member of the board said that if the economy continued to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the future. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The minutes showed that another member of the board said that due to the limits of policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncertainties centered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he added.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is necessary to sustain the strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the global trade war.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, had agreed to separately pay $20 million fines to the financial regulators, and Musk would resign as President of the company, but still held the post of CEO.</seg>
<seg id="3">This settlement agreement would end two months of unrest in Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="4">This settlement agreement on securities fraud charge released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday would make investors relieved.</seg>
<seg id="5">Investors were originally worried that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which was still losing money.</seg>
<seg id="6">SEC prosecuted Musk for frauds on Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the investors.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet said that he was considering to privatize Tesla with $420 per share and had obtained financing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SEC said that these tweets actually had no evidences and the volatility in market triggered by them had hurt investors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Investors and corporate governance experts said that this agreement could strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Steven Heim, the leader of assets management company of Boston Common, said that this settlement agreement should let Musk receive more monitoring, but had not taken any "destructive" measures to throw him out of Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="11">This assets management company held shares of Panasonic, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint a independent president, two independent directors and a board committee to set out controls aiming at Musk’s external communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This matter was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, which met the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">The charge on Thursday caused the market value of Tesla evaporate about $7 billion. The market value of this company was $45.2 billion, lower than $47.5 billion of General Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">SEC withdrew the requirement for throwing Musk out of the head position of the company.</seg>
<seg id="16">Many investors said that this punishment would be catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I think it is the best possible result for all relevant staff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners said. Feinseth gave a "neutral" evaluation to Tesla and said that the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The fact that he still holds the position of CEO is very important to Tesla. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Report on November 5 in Inner Mongolia of China News (reported by Li Aiping): the Hohhot Customs said on November 5 that 46 types of local import and export supervision licenses were verified online from that day, except for confidentiality requirements and other special circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="3">The enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare relevant documents to the Customs in paperless way, so as to avoid the problems of rushing around on site, paper application, repeated submission, etc.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was known that the preparation time of documents referred to the preparation time of various types of documents required for import and export before declaration, which was a major factor that affected the overall clearance time. In order to compress the clearance time and reduce the clearance costs, the documents must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">Previously, there were 86 types of supervision documents in the import and export process which required customs examination, involving 19 departments.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was reported that according to the principle of "to cancel what can be canceled, to merge what can be merged and to withdraw what can be withdrawn from port inspection" this time and relying on the international trade "single window" platform, the Customs and other 16 license-issuing authority systems made docking and data interconnection, to achieve more data flows and less enterprise errands.</seg>
<seg id="7">The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the onsite office hall of the relevant authorities to submit paper applications. The process was long and it was impossible to track the verification status in real time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now the enterprise users can directly log into the "single window" portal to apply online.</seg>

<seg id="2">Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase of empty-nest youth</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report on Day 5 of Yonhap, last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="4">The analysis suggests that this growth is related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.</seg>
<seg id="5">This data is published by the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China was 100,339 US dollars and the weight was 21,859 kg, which surged by 2094% and 3668.8 % respectively compared with that in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">The analysis suggests that the increasing sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of this year, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises are also aiming at the “eating-alone people" and launching various convenience food.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the analysis also indicates that bird flu is the biggest factor which prevents ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.</seg>
<seg id="10">aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 to April of last year. Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars. Due to bird flu, the export sales of last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.</seg>

<seg id="6">Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is second" is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."</seg>
<seg id="10">Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressuring is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one</seg>
<seg id="11">As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization.</seg>
<seg id="12">Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.</seg>
<seg id="13">At present, in the face of the international community’s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1">A message from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City in Shanxi Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River located in this county would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it didn't meet the requirements to be open to the public.</seg>
<seg id="2">In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second biggest fall in China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Yellow River flows here at great speed, and the stone walls on both sides are rising steeply. The river mouth becomes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation that "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to be collected into a kettle".</seg>
<seg id="5">The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October. Due to high levels of water, the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had been closed one after another since July 12, 2018. Therefore, according to the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ni Yufeng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, said to the media that it was the longest time for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the past 20 years. "It hasn't been closed for such a long time. We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017. However, it has been closed for nearly a month. "</seg>
<seg id="7">It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance in order to be well-prepared for the "National Day" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the "Notice on Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday" issued in the "Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control in the Yellow River during the National Day holiday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.</seg>

<seg id="2">The health station has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-strain flu vaccine this year and at this stage, free vaccination is preferentially provided for high-risk people. To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm during the National Day Holidays ( October 1 through 2).</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination service time to 8 pm from Monday to Friday. By 4 pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the same period last year for 3,714 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Free vaccination objects include the following Macao residents: people under the age of 6 months to 18 years, people at the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases (including fat people, namely, the persons whose body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more), staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, all the health workers and the Macao residents who work in the casino.</seg>
<seg id="5">Meanwhile, for the other people who are considered to be necessary to vaccinate by the Health Bureau, including the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain the list and then the health centers will arrange them for vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="6">To facilitate the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to Macao middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the elderly and disabled, public sectors or other institutions with a large number of people to perform collective influenza vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="7">Students and children who fail to participate in the collective vaccination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student identity cards, employee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or health centers from December 3, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Health Bureau reminds residents that people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 2018, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere has been updated , which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winter of 2018-2019 and summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id="9">The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January till March every year, later than that of the temperate regions (such as Northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau urges the elderly, children, pregnant women, fat people and chronic patients who are at high risk of complications after being infected with influenza and people who are in regular contact with high-risk people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in September, as raw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="2">This survey almost didn’t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business capital expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="4">The active capital expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd..</seg>
<seg id="7">"Confident is still at a high level. And since corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.</seg>
<seg id="9">The median market forecast is positive 22.</seg>
<seg id="10">The judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 24 researched in June to positive 22 in September, worsening for the first time for eight quarters.</seg>
<seg id="11">The survey of Reuters was positive 22.</seg>
<seg id="12">The survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing was expected to remain stable in December.</seg>
<seg id="13">Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment index for the boom of Tankan enterprises. The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="14">The capital expenditure was robust.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.</seg>
<seg id="18">Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble era.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said, "considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. "</seg>
<seg id="20">The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot. It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.</seg>
<seg id="22">Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy which depended on exports.</seg>

<seg id="3">At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.</seg>
<seg id="5">The amount of export transactions was 206.494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">From the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7">From the perspective of the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="8">Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China’s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. " Xu Bing said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The China’s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February.</seg>
<seg id="12">In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation. Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.</seg>
<seg id="3">The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of last month.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1">Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition with the theme of import, has officially opened in much anticipation.</seg>
<seg id="2">An exhibition is like a "window" which can let the world know a city and a country better.</seg>
<seg id="3">Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For a country, opening-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. There will be pain, but there will be new life. "</seg>
<seg id="5">General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reveals an important reason "why China can do it".</seg>
<seg id="6">Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market. Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always faces all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id="7">So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that "China's opening door won't close, but would open wider and wider".</seg>
<seg id="9">Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply for a stand", which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fields and at a deeper level.</seg>
<seg id="10">More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroad.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under such era background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is fast to go alone but it is further to go in crowds.</seg>
<seg id="14">By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Road fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.</seg>
<seg id="16">CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="17">On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new step into the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Apart from companies of various countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.</seg>
<seg id="19">By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">As China's opening-up door opens wider and wider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid.</seg>
<seg id="21">From a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only when the world is doing well can China do well; when China is good, the world is better.</seg>
<seg id="23">We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and the world build a community of human destiny.</seg>

<seg id="1">Over 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women’s needs.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the Overseas Chinese News Network of South America, data released by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country’s population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Brazil, the number of the women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women’s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Politics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups advocated by citizens. But the politics of Brazil belong to a monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented. "</seg>
<seg id="9">A previous study by the Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in National Congress, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political field in Brazil. " Natalia Mori said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although there is the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">The survey shows that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If the trade war only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "</seg>
<seg id="5">He also pointed out that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. "</seg>
<seg id="6">In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK$16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK$9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Exchange Fund was mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.</seg>
<seg id="9">As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. "</seg>
<seg id="11">The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars. And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the US dollar. Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further.

<seg id="1">The confinement center without "threshold": quality certification would promote the quality.</seg>
<seg id="2">As the "two-child economic" develops and the maternal and child market thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities.</seg>
<seg id="3">The popular confinement service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution had no threshold at all, and there was still the There is still a blank zone in regulation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child care services.</seg>
<seg id="5">A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bathing and touching.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful figure.</seg>
<seg id="8">A new mother there told the reporter that she had booked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.</seg>
<seg id="9">The service items of confinement service center would directly impact the parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement. Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, including the irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service provider.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers. It is important for the long-term development of enterprises. " he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns. If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.</seg>
<seg id="2">Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected would be those who bought properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="3">When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time.</seg>
<seg id="4">"However, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. "</seg>
<seg id="5">Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, and that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.</seg>
<seg id="6">As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy. In the second quarter this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, Chen Delin said that high shock resistance didn’t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn’t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and those who bought properties at peak times would be the first to be affected.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).</seg>
<seg id="12">However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage.</seg>
<seg id="14">As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.</seg>

<seg id="1">ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei & Liu Shumeng) -- It was the first day of the National Day "Golden Week" in the mainland on October 1. And it was also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, while many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen. The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways. This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 4290000 people and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the boarder by 16:00 that afternoon. The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers taking advantage of the National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more countries providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens.</seg>
<seg id="4">The passenger (car) flow peak in the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1. The passenger flow peak in Luohu port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen to work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exit and entry would not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance in the crowded was enhanced, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".</seg>
<seg id="2">Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University People’s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.</seg>
<seg id="4">In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and member of Peking University People’s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study. It was found that patients with immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The reporter learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="8">Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy.

<seg id="1">This is not shield mistakes, but acting by law.</seg>
<seg id="2">Lawyers took an axe to the court?</seg>
<seg id="3">The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also caused a great disturbance in the legal circle.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.</seg>
<seg id="7">An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reversal of the event stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant’s weapon, but it is not put the first edge. It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intention of "endangering the court security".</seg>
<seg id="9">Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the court open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the court.</seg>
<seg id="10">Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.</seg>
<seg id="11">After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.</seg>
<seg id="12">And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.</seg>
<seg id="13">As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People’s Courts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and there have been few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks.</seg>
<seg id="17">In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the past, individual Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.</seg>
<seg id="20">The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Which tax benefits will affect our money bag from October 1?</seg>
<seg id="2">Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported by Sang Tong) -- The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from January 1, 2019. In order to have the broad masses of the people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as possible, the tax will firstly be deducted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="3">With the implementation of new policy, which benefits will really affect the people's money bag?</seg>
<seg id="4">The first benefit: the income tax will be reduced significantly in the job salaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The taxpayer receiving the job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied. Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan after deducting the "three insurances and one fund", the taxable amounts after the tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by the units in October but have been paid at the end of September according to laws.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.</seg>
<seg id="9">The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rates will be obviously widened.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">This time, seven grades of tax rates of job salaries are the same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grades of tax rates are obviously changed. The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are the same as before.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% has been increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuan.</seg>
<seg id="13">This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">"From the perspective of measurement and calculation of personal tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the personal income tax reform, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Lan Min, the head of Personal Income Tax Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The third benefit: the tax service will become more convenient and optimized.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shanghai tax departments have carried out a series of comprehensive activities of tax propaganda since the announcement of the new personal income tax law.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the one hand, they provided the policy guidance on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the important tax sources and important enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="19">Pudong New Area Tax Bureau has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively. These enterprises have a large number of employees and a large amount of works in withholding and remitting tax, so the tax department actively provided coaching and answered questions; Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited some large labor service enterprises, including CIIC Financial Consulting Ltd. and CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd. within the district. It collected their concerned problems, responded to their appeals, and resolved their difficulties in a timely way.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax policy promotion for the citizen taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="21">They used Shanhai Tax official website, WeChat official account, MicroBlog and other resources to post the hot topics and ensured that the policy announcements were in place.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the same time, Shanghai Tax WeChat official account has put the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform since September 28. It would carry out the "targeted" integrated intelligent services of personal income tax reform via the "Human+Intelligence" tax service consultation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The result of the Election of Okinawa Governor, which was conducted ahead of schedule because the former governor Onaga Takeshi had died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time. Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating the US military base in Japan, was elected successfully.</seg>

<seg id="3">A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lower than that of the Election of Okinawa Governor in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time. The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.</seg>
<seg id="2">This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.</seg>
<seg id="4">The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which is for the first time in 35 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason why the farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.</seg>
<seg id="6">China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported from America, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas said that the soybean price "brings us a heavy blow".</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs was $8.50.</seg>
<seg id="10">The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high record.</seg>
<seg id="11">At such a vulnerable time, they are hit by the trade war.</seg>
<seg id="12">As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July.</seg>
<seg id="13">The United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.</seg>
<seg id="14">This estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of soybeans will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">Informa also predicted that the cultivated area of wheats in America would increase by 4%.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cultivated area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008. The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson’s family is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the largest soybean cultivation state in America.</seg>
<seg id="21">The yields per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="22">If farmers switch production to corns, the cost may increase. But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production to corns.</seg>

<seg id="4">In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and pulled up the elder uncle.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent their hates": Why can’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?</seg>
<seg id="6">Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?</seg>
<seg id="7">And for the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up because of "Road see injustice"?</seg>
<seg id="8">The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="10">This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is the first day of the National Day holiday in October 1. There is a surge in the vehicles heading for Mao County and Songpan County via Beichuan Qiang Minority Autonomous County in Sichuan.</seg>
<seg id="2">Beichuan Traffic Police received a call for help at about 13:00 saying that a family member had a traffic accident in Songpan and was badly in need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment due to the limited local medical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, so the caller hoped the traffic police would permit the 120 emergency ambulance to pass though the road.</seg>
<seg id="4">After getting the call for help, the policeman on duty quickly reported this to the traffic police group. After understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There were more than 1000 vehicles having entered the controlled road segment at that time. After contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beichuan at about 15:00, so we implemented the arrangement and deployment immediately. "</seg>
<seg id="6">The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles in the road segment from running side by side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in the beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Later, the policemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a line to make a way for the incoming 120 emergency ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="8">An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15:00, and Beichuan Traffic Police sent a police car to clear the way and escort the emergency ambulance into the controlled road segment by driving against the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only permitted one vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at these places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to use the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the normal road of the 302 provincial highway. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Da Wei explained that the overall passing time needed to be 4 hours under normal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This arrangement has successfully saved precious treatment time for the patient. "</seg>
<seg id="14">It was learned that the critically ill patient was timely sent to Mianyang for treatment at 17:20.</seg>

<seg id="3">This is the first pickpocket case cracked by Beijing police during the National Day holiday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The anti-pickpocket investigators of Beijing Police Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at the designated position at about 5:00 yesterday morning.</seg>

<seg id="8">On the bus, the two men standing on the left and right of the male passenger, and one of them tried to provide cover for the other.</seg>
<seg id="9">But they didn't know that the plainclothes policemen standing by were paying close attention to their every movement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Catch the thief with the stolen goods". It was very critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose the timing of catching the thief. While waiting for the men to steal, the policemen had to keep their eyes on them, who were preparing for the pickpocket. As soon as they succeeded in pickpocket, the investigators caught them at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned that the policemen ferreted out 800 yuan cash from the suspected pickpockets.</seg>

<seg id="16">The plainclothes policeman told the reporter that it was easy for the policeman to recognize the suspects in the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You will find out that the thieves' eyes and expressions were different from the ordinary passengers' when you have caught a number of thieves. In addition to staring at other people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to get into the crowd instead of avoiding the crowd. "</seg>
<seg id="18">The policeman also told the reporter that the suspects were often purposeless while waiting for the bus. They liked to wander at the bus station and would follow the target to get on a bus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"These are the voices of experience. If you have worked as a plainclothes policeman for a long time enough, you will know it quite sensibly. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Furthermore, the policeman also reminded: "It is the most convenient to put things in the coat pocket, but it will be the easiest to be stolen. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Therefore, the Ministry of Education issues a notice that requires the sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to implement the new national standard before delivery for use after November 1.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mandatory national standard "The sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools" is led by the Ministry of Education. 26 research institutes and testing organizations have participated in drafting the standard and it have gone through more than two years of revision. During that time, more than 100 meetings of expert argument were held, and the nationwide field studies and sampling inspections were implemented. Countless validation experiments have been collected from products of hundreds of enterprises on the market.</seg>
<seg id="4">The reporter contrasts the old national standard in 2005 and finds that the new national standard has not only changed from the "national recommended standard" to the "national mandatory standard", but also added a lot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, requirements for inorganic filler content, requirements for anti-slip colloidal particle polymer content, limits of harmful substances of surface finished products, limits of harmful substances of non-solid and solid materials, etc.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the new national standard limits the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction process of campus plastic runway, increasing from 7 to 18 items, and stipulates the limits of volatile organic compounds in the built runway according to the standard of home decoration.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, the release amount of harmful substances is specified in the "Limits of cast-in-situ and prefabricated surface finished products and odor requirements", which requires that the total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/cubic meter, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 mg/cubic meter, carbon disulfide should not exceed 7 mg/cubic meter, benzene should not exceed 0.1 mg/cubic meter, and the odor grade should not be higher than Grade 3.</seg>

<seg id="1">For activating rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent.</seg>
<seg id="5">A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half.</seg>
<seg id="6">The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?</seg>
<seg id="7">Different from the urban markets, farmers’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">One product has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea of "going to the mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste elimination markets", both of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.</seg>
<seg id="10">From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development type consumption.</seg>
<seg id="11">A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rural consumption really flourish.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments. According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed in the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down. If there is a problem in any part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.</seg>
<seg id="15">Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets. Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy with confidence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Activate rural consumption, guide the demand for healthy consumption.</seg>
<seg id="17">As consumption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to "low quality" and "low price".</seg>
<seg id="18">This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.</seg>
