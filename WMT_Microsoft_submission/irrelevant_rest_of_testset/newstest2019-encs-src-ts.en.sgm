<p>
<seg id="1">"Parenthood," this summer's successful and amusing movie about parents and children, apparently was only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="2">It seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother's death, or adoption, or aging parents, or pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="3">And why not?</seg>
<seg id="4">Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen -- have taken a cue from Chekhov: When it comes to compelling drama, there's no place like home.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet too many people working in Hollywood today seem to suffer from the delusion that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some diaries simply aren't worth snooping in.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet there will be people who will sob at "Immediate Family," a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption.</seg>
<seg id="9">These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people's troubles, no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told.</seg>
<seg id="10">Written by Barbara Benedek, co-author of "The Big Chill," "Immediate Family" takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children.</seg>
<seg id="11">The film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging.</seg>
<seg id="12">Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive parents (Glenn Close and James Woods) and the teen-age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption (Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon).</seg>
<seg id="13">Linda and Michael (Ms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Close and Mr. Woods), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="15">All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="16">The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.</seg>
<seg id="17">Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility, Linda and Michael decide to adopt.</seg>
<seg id="18">The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one -- or maybe they're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script, and Jonathan Kaplan's ("The Accused") dull direction.</seg>
<seg id="19">Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score; when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of "I Can See Clearly Now." The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother, so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy's (Ms.</seg>
<seg id="20">Masterson) bus ticket from Ohio. (Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from Ohio?</seg>
<seg id="21">I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan.) Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everyone falls in love with everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is some pain, when Lucy has the baby and "didn't know she would feel like this" and wants to keep the baby.</seg>
<seg id="24">But in the end, everything turns out for the best, in the film makers' warped view.</seg>
<seg id="25">Like lawyers in the hostile takeover field, the baby goes where the money is.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the other end of the life cycle is "Dad," Gary David Goldberg's adaptation of the William Wharton novel.</seg>
<seg id="27">This picture is about a middle-aged son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies.</seg>
<seg id="28">The glib emotional style Mr. Goldberg has perfected on television's "Family Ties" doesn't benefit from magnification.</seg>
<seg id="29">His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions, like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days.</seg>
<seg id="30">They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction, like tourists cataloging the sights they've seen from the window of a bus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Not even Jack Lemmon's expert doddering makes this trip worth taking.</seg>
<seg id="32">So it's entirely possible that "Look Who's Talking" isn't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now.</seg>
<seg id="33">But by comparison, this fluffy comedy seems like a gem.</seg>
<seg id="34">It starts with conception, taking the sperm's point of view, then progresses to the baby's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="35">Bruce Willis's best attribute as an actor is his coy, lazy voice, and that's all you get of him here, speaking for the baby.</seg>
<seg id="36">Finally, there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its stars are bears.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the second time, in a movie called "The Bear," French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be. ("Quest for Fire" was the first time.) To be sure, one wonders what kind of man is this, who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="38">Supposedly, he proposed the movie to his producer, Claude Berri, in four lines: "An orphan bear cub.</seg>
<seg id="39">A big solitary bear.</seg>
<seg id="40">Two hunters in the forest.</seg>
<seg id="41">The animals' point of view."</seg>
<seg id="42">But then, even a great many words couldn't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who adopts a parent.</seg>
<seg id="43">Video Tip: One of the best movies about the child-parent thing in recent years was "Raising Arizona," the 1987 Coen brothers' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door.</seg>

<seg id="1">Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'</seg>
<seg id="2">There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).</seg>
<seg id="3">It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="4">AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="5">One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."</seg>
<seg id="6">For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="8">A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.</seg>
<seg id="12">In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.</seg>
<seg id="14">AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.</seg>
<seg id="16">AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name</seg>
<seg id="2">Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."</seg>
<seg id="3">The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.</seg>

<seg id="1">Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites, the Office of Thrift Supervision said.</seg>
<seg id="2">But that doesn't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The office, an arm of the Treasury, said it doesn't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus can't determine why blacks are rejected more often.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, on Capitol Hill, where the information was released yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing, lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sen. Alan Dixon (D, Ill.), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said, "I'm not a statistician.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities, it is three and four times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">James Grohl, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said, "The data is a red flag, but lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread." The trade group official added: "Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it."</seg>
<seg id="9">Sen. Dixon held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending.</seg>
<seg id="10">The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race, sex and income level of borrowers, but that information won't be gathered in new studies for several months at least.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years, which adjust for income differences and other variables, showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">But John LaWare, a Fed governor, told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed's believes the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating.</seg>
<seg id="13">For instance, he noted, the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites.</seg>
<seg id="14">Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination. "We would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years" to developing examinations for discrimination, said Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If we've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly," said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the banking committee, "then that is a matter that needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now."</seg>
<seg id="16">Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The FDIC said it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices.</seg>
<seg id="18">The comptroller's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The comptroller's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987, only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending.</seg>
<seg id="20">The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thrift regulators didn't give any figures on their enforcement actions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Fiechter said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of "testers" -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions, but Mr. Grohl said the U.S. League of Savings Institutions hadn't yet taken any position on the matter.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle</seg>
<seg id="2">"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Today, there's neither."</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="5">"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."</seg>
<seg id="7">As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."</seg>
<seg id="8">Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."</seg>
<seg id="10">Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.</seg>
<seg id="11">The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="12">A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.</seg>
<seg id="13">St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."</seg>
<seg id="16">The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."</seg>
<seg id="17">The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.</seg>
<seg id="19">What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.</seg>

<seg id="2">A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!</seg>
<seg id="6">I got bit!'</seg>
<seg id="7">His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.</seg>
<seg id="9">The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.</seg>
<seg id="12">Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="1">An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2">Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall.</seg>
<seg id="4">To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative.</seg>
<seg id="6">The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home.</seg>
<seg id="7">A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould, 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster, and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids, according to Barbara Hammond, the museum's director.</seg>
<seg id="8">He sold them well below market value to raise cash "to pay off mounting credit-card debts," incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, Philip Russell, told IFAR.</seg>
<seg id="9">The curator, 27-year-old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich, Conn., had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The theft was discovered early this year, soon after Ms. Hammond took her post.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sentencing was postponed on Aug. 18, when Mr. Krisher was hospitalized for depression.</seg>
<seg id="12">His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on Oct. 6, he had reason to celebrate.</seg>
<seg id="14">Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $62,800.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, New York City police seized the stolen goods, and Mr. Krisher avoided jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $45,000.</seg>
<seg id="17">Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo," that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Valued at $1.3 million, it was part of a four-crate shipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The air-waybill number was changed en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be "lost." Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said, "It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted."</seg>
<seg id="21">Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree.</seg>
<seg id="22">Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured column krater and shipped it from London.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was reported stolen in transit en route to Washington, D.C., in February.</seg>
<seg id="24">Months later, the Greek vase arrived in good condition at the museum in Charlottesville, having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through Nairobi.</seg>
<seg id="25">Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec objects, including some of Mexico's best-known archaeological treasures, were taken.</seg>
<seg id="27">The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="28">As it turned out, Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family's home for a year.</seg>
<seg id="29">Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art.</seg>
<seg id="31">Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich.</seg>
<seg id="32">The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to a source at the East Europe desk, two previously convicted felons were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">The precious canvas, cut from its frame at the time of the theft, was found in nearby Jena, hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves.</seg>
<seg id="35">No charges were brought against her.</seg>
<seg id="36">Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but Robert Lawrence Trotter, 35, of Kennett Square, Pa., took his fooling seriously.</seg>
<seg id="37">He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge, Conn.</seg>
<seg id="38">Mr. Trotter's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr. Trotter's fake Haberle was offered at a bargain price of $25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in New Canaan, Conn.</seg>
<seg id="40">The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came to see it as a fake.</seg>
<seg id="41">They persuaded Mr. Trotter to take it back and, with the help of the FBI, taped their conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="42">After his arrest, the forger admitted to faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.</seg>
<seg id="7">The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.</seg>
<seg id="12">The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.</seg>
<seg id="17">We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."</seg>

<seg id="2">Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV</seg>
<seg id="3">Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.</seg>
<seg id="5">This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.</seg>
<seg id="6">Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.</seg>
<seg id="8">The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.</seg>

<seg id="4">Trump said in his mock "news anchor" voice.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I didn't give up anything."</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="8">More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.</seg>
<seg id="8">While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.</seg>
<seg id="11">Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="12">A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.</seg>
<seg id="13">President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.</seg>
<seg id="14">But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.</seg>

<seg id="2">Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal with his team trailing 1-0.</seg>
<seg id="4">He tapped the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the far post.</seg>
<seg id="5">The attempt sailed high above the box as it drifted toward the right top corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn't think about it too much and just took the shot on."</seg>
<seg id="9">Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after getting a score in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Blues striker heeled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before spinning off near midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at midfield.</seg>
<seg id="12">He then fired a beautiful through ball, leading Hazard into the box.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hazard outran the defense and finished into the far post netting with a left footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.</seg>

<seg id="1">You know what the law of averages is, don't you?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's what 1) explains why we are like, well, ourselves rather than Bo Jackson; 2) cautions that it's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep; and 3) predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Baseball, that game of the long haul, is the quintessential sport of the mean, and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="4">The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A's, the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year's tournament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Morever, much of the damage was accomplished by A's who had some catching up to do.</seg>
<seg id="6">In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.</seg>
<seg id="7">He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup. "If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen," he later remarked.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.</seg>
<seg id="11">The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision.</seg>
<seg id="12">Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.</seg>
<seg id="13">That he was the A's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark, plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs, indicates he may have some evening up coming, but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving, that might not be this week.</seg>
<seg id="14">The same goes for Mike Moore, another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday's contest.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before," marveled Giant manager Roger Craig.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's an ex-hurler who's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery, which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat.</seg>
<seg id="17">The upshot of the downshoot is that the A's go into San Francisco's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest.</seg>
<seg id="18">The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all.</seg>
<seg id="19">That's not an average to soothe Giant rooters.</seg>
<seg id="20">One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART (that's a better name for a public conveyance than "Desire," don't you think?) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings, but they observe them in relative calm.</seg>
<seg id="21">Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see.</seg>
<seg id="22">A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams. "I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="23">I love 'em both.</seg>
<seg id="24">The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games," said David Williams, a Sacramento septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go.</seg>
<seg id="25">The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility.</seg>
<seg id="26">I choose to believe it's the latter, although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="27">Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans, and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets.</seg>
<seg id="28">Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.</seg>
<seg id="30">He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three-run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season, the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not his autograph; power-hitter McGwire's.</seg>
<seg id="33">An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation.</seg>
<seg id="34">He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run. "When you're in the groove, you see every ball tremendously," he lectured.</seg>
<seg id="35">The cold guys in the set were Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams, the Giants' 3-4-5 hitters.</seg>
<seg id="36">They combined for 25 hits, six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs.</seg>
<seg id="37">They went a collective 5-for-24 here, with zero homers and ribbies.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come. "I believe in the law of averages," declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two. "I'd rather see a so-so hitter who's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who's cold."</seg>
<seg id="39">But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side. "When it goes, you never know when you'll get it back," he said. "That's baseball."</seg>

<seg id="2">THE YOM KIPPUR WAR, WHEN EGYPT CRASHED into Israel on Oct. 6, 1973, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, lasted barely a month.</seg>
<seg id="3">But one far-afield effect is still with us.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Arab states, always bitterly resentful of U.S. support toward Israel, realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil.</seg>
<seg id="5">Early in October, six Arab nations in the Persian Gulf jacked up prices sharply.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Oct. 22, led by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, they embargoed oil shipments to the U.S. and to the Netherlands, Israel's staunchest European ally.</seg>
<seg id="7">The timing was perfect.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Arabs had tried embargos before.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 1956, when Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt to seize the Suez Canal, Arab producers cut off supplies to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">Texas simply pumped harder.</seg>
<seg id="11">U.S. oil supplies, however, had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining.</seg>
<seg id="12">Imports, then six million barrels a day, came primarily from Venezuela and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Middle East supplies were growing in importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">By 1973, the U.S. was bringing in two million barrels of Arab oil a day, more than 10% of the 17.3 million barrels consumed daily.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politics and economics conspired.</seg>
<seg id="16">Japan and Europe, far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S., wouldn't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">The U.S. did manage to supply the Dutch with oil by relabeling supplies; once oil is shipped, no one can tell its source.</seg>
<seg id="18">But car-happy Americans panicked, and so did the U.S. and other oil-consuming governments. "Shortage" and "crisis" became buzz words, although neither really applied.</seg>
<seg id="19">The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion (much of it in Washington), though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile-long lines at the gas pumps.</seg>
<seg id="20">The embargo lasted only six months, but the price hikes became a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="21">What the Arabs started, inflation finished.</seg>
<seg id="22">Once and for all, $5-a-barrel crude oil and 35-cents-a-gallon gasoline were history.</seg>

<seg id="1">WALL STREET, SHAKE hands with George Orwell.</seg>
<seg id="2">The author of the futuristic novel "1984" invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is, anything negative about the policies and practices of the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wall Street hasn't gotten that far yet, but it has made a promising start.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous, reassuring, and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better, safer or cheaper than they really are.</seg>
<seg id="5">When something undeniably nasty happens, a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear, much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, we'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrong.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market, it never happened.</seg>
<seg id="9">In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19, 1987, was just a big blip.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term, New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only "a major technical correction."</seg>
<seg id="11">(Another much-beloved saying, however, this one in plain English, holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Oct. 29, 1929 -- a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the DJ industrials fell 12.8%.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the "technical correction" of two years ago, they lost a whopping 22.6%.)</seg>
<seg id="14">Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock.</seg>
<seg id="15">These people used to be called brokers, but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction, when terrified customers couldn't raise brokers on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Either way, the word "broker" is clearly out of favor.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of the major New York-based securities firms, only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers.</seg>
<seg id="18">At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., they are "financial consultants." At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Prudential Bache Securities, and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., they are "account executives." At PaineWebber Inc., they are "investment executives."</seg>
<seg id="19">Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified, broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today's myriad financial products.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves, overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle, don't feel. "Its almost product de jour," grouses one account executive at Dean Witter.</seg>
<seg id="21">The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips, instead stressing such terms as "safe," "insured" and "guaranteed" -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product.</seg>
<seg id="22">The names of some of these products don't suggest the risk involved in buying them, either.</seg>
<seg id="23">A case in point: "government-plus" bond funds.</seg>
<seg id="24">What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds?</seg>
<seg id="25">What could be better than getting a tad more income from them (the plus) than other people?</seg>
<seg id="26">Indeed, conservative investors, many of them elderly, have poured more than $50 billion into such funds, which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options, a gambler's game.</seg>
<seg id="27">When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished, look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker.</seg>
<seg id="28">This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships, many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are still being sold, but more and more often as "direct investments" -- with all the same risks they had under the old label.</seg>
<seg id="30">In such cases, the game hasn't changed, only the name.</seg>
<seg id="31">In others a familiar old name still prevails, but the underlying game has changed.</seg>
<seg id="32">For example, "no load" mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they don't carry a frontend sales commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Getting out of them, however, may be a different story now.</seg>
<seg id="34">Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6% -- when an investor sells his shares.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shouldn't they properly be called exit-load funds?</seg>
<seg id="37">The mutual-fund industry is debating the question, but don't expect a new name while the old one is working so well.</seg>
<seg id="38">And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were.</seg>
<seg id="39">American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for one, is still a favorite of widows, orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side, it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also, blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="41">Larry Biehl, a money manager in San Mateo, Calif., blames that on the advent of program trading, in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail.</seg>
<seg id="42">Blue chips, he says, "are now being referred to as poker chips."</seg>
<seg id="43">Finally, even the time-honored strategy called "value investing" no longer means what it once did.</seg>
<seg id="44">Before the takeover mania of the '80s, it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks, especially those with shrewd management, sound fundamentals and decent prospects.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now, says Mr. Biehl, value investing often means "looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble." To institutional investors or brokers, he adds, a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up.</seg>

<seg id="2">A murder investigation has been launched after woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man being arrested on suspicion of murder.</seg>
<seg id="4">Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="5">Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would also appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.'</seg>
<seg id="7">A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found is local to Birkenhead and she was found inside a property.</seg>
<seg id="8">This afternoon friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">Investigations are ongoing as police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.</seg>
<seg id="10">A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his flat but is being told by police no one is allowed in or out of the building.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was speechless when he discovered what happened.</seg>
<seg id="12">Residents are now being told it will be hours until they are allowed back in.</seg>
<seg id="13">A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.</seg>
<seg id="14">A woman appeared at the scene in tears.</seg>
<seg id="15">She keeps repeating 'it's so awful'.</seg>

<seg id="1">Since chalk first touched slate, schoolchildren have wanted to know: What's on the test?</seg>
<seg id="2">These days, students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: "What is another name for the Roman numeral IX?" It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Worksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials, sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., contain the same questions.</seg>
<seg id="5">In many other instances, there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials.</seg>
<seg id="6">What's more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan's parent, Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp.</seg>
<seg id="7">Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common, some educators and researchers say.</seg>
<seg id="8">Test-preparation booklets, software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.</seg>
<seg id="9">But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn't cheating," says John Kaminski, a Traverse City, Mich., teacher who has studied test coaching.</seg>
<seg id="11">He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which is to gauge learning progress.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history," says John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which has studied standardized testing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan/McGraw's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sales figures of the test-prep materials aren't known, but their reach into schools is significant.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas, educators say they are common classroom tools.</seg>
<seg id="17">Macmillan/McGraw says "well over 10 million" of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers' binders have also been sold in the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The materials in each set reach about 90 students.</seg>
<seg id="20">Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests.</seg>
<seg id="21">Michael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw, the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn't aimed at improving test scores.</seg>
<seg id="22">He also asserted that exact questions weren't replicated.</seg>
<seg id="23">When referred to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.</seg>
<seg id="25">They devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT.</seg>
<seg id="26">Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says, the preparation kits wouldn't replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scoring High matched on 64.5.</seg>
<seg id="29">In CAT sections where students' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know.</seg>
<seg id="30">Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items.</seg>
<seg id="31">Rick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring "the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format." He said authors of Scoring High "scrupulously avoid" replicating exact questions, but he doesn't deny that some items are similar.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House.</seg>
<seg id="34">McGraw-Hill was outraged.</seg>
<seg id="35">In a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw-Hill said Scoring High shouldn't be used because it represented a "parallel form" of the CAT and CTBS tests.</seg>
<seg id="36">But in 1988, McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw.</seg>
<seg id="37">Messrs.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High.</seg>

<seg id="1">Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2">In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee, Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, who told a House panel Wednesday that he doesn't want the ability to halt the markets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed.</seg>
<seg id="4">He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Separately, Mr. Brady said he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets to determine whether futures margins are too low.</seg>
<seg id="7">He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate," Mr. Brady said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract.</seg>
<seg id="10">Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures stood at $10,000 a contract for speculators and $5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16, 1987; that day the hedging margin was raised to $7,500.</seg>
<seg id="12">Margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19, 1987.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, they stand at $12,000 for speculators, who are typically individuals and non-member traders, and $6,000 for hedgers, which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to "end under (its) own weight." Asked whether there is anything Congress should do to curb the LBO boom, Mr. Brady responded, "I think the LBO phenomenon, (while) it won't stop completely, will be a thing of the past." Before taking any action, he advised the panel to "see what the market has produced as a cure."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Brady also agreed with senators' concerns about recent stock-market volatility, and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">But he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds.</seg>
<seg id="17">The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading, which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago. "I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session.</seg>
<seg id="19">That bill, proposed by the SEC last year, would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies, mandate large traders' reporting of program or block trades, and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill.</seg>

<seg id="1">IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence, it would probably be a one-word sentence: Diversify.</seg>
<seg id="2">Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc., serious investors have taken that advice to heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal's poll, providing an in-depth look at their portfolios.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those portfolios are remarkably diversified.</seg>
<seg id="5">By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives, the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area, be it stocks, bonds or real estate.</seg>
<seg id="6">For example, about 88% of Journal readers owned stock (down slightly from 91% in a similar poll last year).</seg>
<seg id="7">But only 17.5% said they had more than half their money in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="8">Similarly, 57% of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund, and 33% own municipal bonds.</seg>
<seg id="9">But only 6% to 7% of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poll, conducted Aug. 7-28, also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics.</seg>
<seg id="11">It found them in a cautious, but not downbeat, mood.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire, 951 replied.</seg>
<seg id="13">The response rate, more than 63%, allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results can't be extrapolated to all investors, though.</seg>
<seg id="15">Journal readers are relatively affluent, with a median household income of between $75,000 and $99,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nearly half of the respondents (47%) said their investment portfolio was worth $250,000 or more, and 17% said it was worth $1 million or more.</seg>
<seg id="17">The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets, but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, 12% of this year's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last year, only 8% were expecting a recession.</seg>
<seg id="20">An additional 56% of this year's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Only 42% of last year's respondents anticipated slowing growth.</seg>
<seg id="22">Apparently, the respondents don't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much.</seg>
<seg id="23">A slim majority (51%) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989.</seg>
<seg id="24">Their verdict on real estate is almost the same.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some 50% expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="26">By contrast, only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high, that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though only 12% actually predicted a recession, many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance.</seg>
<seg id="29">Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the most part, the changes were "slight."</seg>
<seg id="31">The two-thirds who haven't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who "don't believe in trying to predict the markets" (about 31%) and investors who "don't expect a recession" (about 15%) or are "unsure if and when a recession might come" (about 22%).</seg>
<seg id="32">A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents.</seg>
<seg id="33">Most own two to 10 stocks, and buy or sell no more than three times a year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some 71% had bought some stock in the past year; only 57% had sold any.</seg>
<seg id="35">But the lurking shadow of 1987's stock-market crash still seems dark.</seg>
<seg id="36">About 33% considered another crash "likely," while about 63% said one is "unlikely." Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year's poll.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the respondents' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual.</seg>
<seg id="38">About 60% of them said they would "ordinarily" have at least 25% of their money in stocks.</seg>
<seg id="39">But as of August, only 50% actually had stock-market investments of that size.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll.</seg>
<seg id="41">But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious, rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon.</seg>

<seg id="1">First, the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="2">Then, the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">What now?</seg>
<seg id="4">To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene, we're back in the age of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="5">Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success, it now seems that so many people feel they're slipping between the cracks, that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lisa Zeidner's third novel, "Limited Partnerships" (North Point Press, 256 pages, $18.95) is a stylish, funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money, or, more specifically, the lack of it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt, 33 and 39 respectively, live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">Malcolm, a former film-maker turned architect, has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady, obnoxious client, a fly-by-night real estate developer.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nora, who still has artistic aspirations, knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist, prepping pies, burgers, frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="10">After all, she reasons, "there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job." But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped.</seg>
<seg id="11">They seem to be having the "worst of both worlds: artistic work with none of art's integrity and no control over the finished product; self-employment without fun or profit."</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a downbeat, "thirtysomething" world, in which bright, still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor, doing free-lance, semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do.</seg>
<seg id="13">Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives.</seg>
<seg id="14">Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit, but Nora finds an extra $30,000 in her bank account, suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold.</seg>
<seg id="15">While she is wondering whether to live it up, and do something even more dramatic, say get married, her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame, David, a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom.</seg>
<seg id="16">In novels of an earlier vintage, David would have represented excitement and danger; Malcolm, placid, middle-class security.</seg>
<seg id="17">The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a "safe" middle-class haven: Nora's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security, with no firm economic base anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="18">The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a "middle way" between the extremes of success and failure, wealth and poverty.</seg>
<seg id="19">In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation, Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters.</seg>
<seg id="20">The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts (even the characters' own) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters.</seg>
<seg id="21">But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="22">In any case, the foundering middle classes aren't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction. "Rascal Money" (Contemporary Books, 412 pages, $17.95), a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber, tells the story of an innovative, well-run, widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW, a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world.</seg>
<seg id="23">Patrician, dynamic Scott Thatcher, founder and head of PegaSys, initially finds the takeover threat risible.</seg>
<seg id="24">But, as he and his skilled team soon discover, they're up against two factors they hadn't counted on: first, a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover; second, that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger, shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel.</seg>
<seg id="26">And like a spy or mystery story, this novel has strong elements of allegory, as the good and evil forces battle it out.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures.</seg>
<seg id="28">Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians, snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author's perceptions.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this: If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible, malicious dolt, we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated, and would not be so diverted in the process.</seg>

<seg id="4">-- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted, I say it directly, a clear violation of ABM. -- Eduard Shevardnadze, Oct. 23, 1989.</seg>
<seg id="5">We're happy, we guess, to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without question, something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo.</seg>
<seg id="8">As it bids for new agreements, new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world, the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">So after 70 years, it is confessing the obvious, hoping to be believed about other things.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not enough.</seg>
<seg id="11">If the Soviets want to be believed, they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious.</seg>
<seg id="12">Our own test of "glasnost's" authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk.</seg>
<seg id="13">The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there, and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Pentagon's recently issued "Soviet Military Power," though in general adopting a softer line, repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat.</seg>
<seg id="17">We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty.</seg>
<seg id="18">And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Soviets' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores.</seg>
<seg id="20">Harvard's Matthew Meselson -- who we read has sold something called the "scientific community" on the notion that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible."</seg>
<seg id="21">We don't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="22">And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself.</seg>
<seg id="24">The U.S. government's Sverdlovsk complaint, as with Krasnoyarsk, is no mere political posturing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or, alternatively, that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident.</seg>
<seg id="28">Until that happens, glasnost cannot begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row</seg>
<seg id="2">Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."</seg>
<seg id="4">John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.</seg>
<seg id="11">His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."</seg>

<seg id="1">(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)</seg>
<seg id="2">MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties (they had been in Britain for a century), but they didn't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="3">By 1980, there were more than 100 such funds.</seg>
<seg id="4">Besides creating a vehicle for investors, money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The idea was to let small investors, the backbone of the fund business, deal in the money market's high short-term interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="6">This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place.</seg>
<seg id="7">The now-standard price of $1 a share came about by accident.</seg>
<seg id="8">An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed $1 price.</seg>
<seg id="9">It arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring.</seg>
<seg id="10">His successor approved the $1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk.</seg>
<seg id="11">When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974, it was priced at $10 a share (and reached $1 billion in assets in one year.) Dreyfus moved to the $1 price after the SEC set standards -- an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">Keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience.</seg>
<seg id="13">Actually, the funds do fluctuate, but beyond the third decimal place.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rounding-off keeps them at $1.</seg>
<seg id="15">Eventually, the money funds' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- 30% of fund owners (there are more than 54 million accounts) started with a money fund.</seg>
<seg id="17">Today more than 470 money market funds have total assets exceeding $350 billion. (The companion tax-exempt funds add $71 billion.) Dreyfus alone has seen its money market funds grow from $1 billion in 1975 to closes to $15 billion today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert.</seg>
<seg id="2">It attracts people with funny hair (or with no hair -- in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his).</seg>
<seg id="3">Whoever constitute the local Left Bank come out in force, dressed in black, along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge.</seg>
<seg id="4">People in Glass houses tend to look stoned.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, if still conscious at the evening's end, you notice something else: The audience, at first entranced and hypnotized by the music, releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="6">Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone.</seg>
<seg id="7">He sits down at the piano and plays.</seg>
<seg id="8">And plays.</seg>
<seg id="9">Either one likes it or one doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="10">The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does.</seg>
<seg id="11">The work, though, sounds like Muzak for spaceships.</seg>
<seg id="12">Philip Glass is the emperor, and his music the new clothes, of the avant-garde.</seg>
<seg id="13">His success is easy to understand.</seg>
<seg id="14">Softly introducing and explaining his pieces, Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The piano compositions, which have been labeled variously as minimalist, Oriental, repetitive, cyclical, monophonic and hypnotic, are relentlessly tonal (therefore unthreatening), unvaryingly rhythmic (therefore soporific), and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic (therefore both pretty and unconventional).</seg>
<seg id="16">It is music for people who want to hear something different but don't want to work especially hard at the task.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is E-Z listening for the now generation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum "less is more." His more is always less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Far from being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex. "Opening" (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: Never straying too far from the piano's center, Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a recognizable musical style here, but not a particular performance style.</seg>
<seg id="22">The music is not especially pianistic; indeed, it's hard to imagine a bad performance of it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nothing bravura, no arpeggios, no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer.</seg>
<seg id="24">We hear, we may think, inner voices, but they all seem to be saying the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="25">With "Planet News," music meant to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg's "Wichita Vortex Sutra," Mr. Glass gets going.</seg>
<seg id="26">His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="27">Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a (very slow) improvisatory riff.</seg>
<seg id="28">The chords modulate, but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys.</seg>
<seg id="29">Contrasts predictably accumulate: First the music is loud, then it becomes soft, then (you realize) it becomes louder again. "The Fourth Knee Play," an interlude from "Einstein on the Beach," is like a toccata but it doesn't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in "Three Blind Mice."</seg>
<seg id="30">When Mr. Glass decides to get really fancy, he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand.</seg>
<seg id="31">He does this in at least three of his solo pieces.</seg>
<seg id="32">You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment.</seg>
<seg id="33">In "Mad Rush," which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length (Mr.</seg>
<seg id="34">Glass charmingly, and tellingly, confessed that "this was no problem for me"), an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="35">Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended, it is also often multiple in its context(s). "Mad Rush" began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama's first public address in the U.S., when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine.</seg>
<seg id="36">Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany, and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces.</seg>
<seg id="37">The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything.</seg>
<seg id="38">The evening ended with Mr. Glass's "Metamorphosis," another multiple work.</seg>
<seg id="39">Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, "The Thin Blue Line," and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name.</seg>
<seg id="40">When used as background in this way, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two-note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film.</seg>
<seg id="41">Served up as a solo, however, the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium.</seg>
<seg id="42">Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz's sense that the 1974 "Music in Twelve Parts" is as encyclopedic and weighty as "The Well-Tempered Clavier." But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes, this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass's music.</seg>
<seg id="43">Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler.</seg>

<seg id="2">A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.</seg>
<seg id="8">A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="9">"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.</seg>
<seg id="10">Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.</seg>
<seg id="11">His body was found about an hour later.</seg>
<seg id="12">The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.</seg>
<seg id="13">A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.</seg>

<seg id="1">An imaginative novelist writing a thriller about amateur spy-chasing might invent a Clifford Stoll, but it's unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="2">It's also unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">Amateur spy-chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person, or as he might waggishly put it, a surreal person.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is 37, an astronomer with impressive credentials, and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding.</seg>
<seg id="5">He once described himself as a "Berkeley Hippie," and played the role well; obligatory ragged jeans, a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional, including, for a time at least, formal marriage to his "sweetheart," Martha Matthews.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also is an entertaining writer, combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work.</seg>
<seg id="7">In "The Cuckoo's Egg" (Doubleday, 326 pages, $19.95), he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy.</seg>
<seg id="8">The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of them, 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S., searching for secrets.</seg>
<seg id="10">He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of the material Hess collected.</seg>
<seg id="11">They promised yet more for really good stuff.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds, making them surrogate parents.</seg>
<seg id="13">The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T.</seg>
<seg id="14">Using Gnu-Emacs, the spy could substitute a bogus "atrun" program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Once his cuckoo's egg was laid, he could enter Unix and become a "super-user," with access to everything.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab's computers.</seg>
<seg id="17">He discovered a 75-cent discrepancy in the charges made to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named "Hunter," who had no valid billing address.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers.</seg>
<seg id="19">But after much tracking, it became evident to Mr. Stoll, through various clues, that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California.</seg>
<seg id="20">Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll.</seg>
<seg id="21">He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab's computers.</seg>
<seg id="22">After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named Joe Sventek, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, to alert him when Sventek came on the line.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some nights he slept under his desk.</seg>
<seg id="24">His boss complained about neglect of other chores.</seg>
<seg id="25">The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="26">The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the hacker moved, Mr. Stoll moved too, calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sometimes, if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file, he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his quarry.</seg>
<seg id="29">The FBI initially showed little interest, and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape.</seg>
<seg id="30">The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage.</seg>
<seg id="31">One learns a lot from this book, or seems to, about crippling federal bureaucracy. "Seems to" because it's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll.</seg>
<seg id="32">Finally, he got help.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tymnet is a major network linking computers.</seg>
<seg id="34">One of its international specialists, Steve White, took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll's hunt, ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany.</seg>
<seg id="35">The West Germans then took over and finally found Markus Hess.</seg>
<seg id="36">Eventually, Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and NSA to brief high-ranking officers on computer theft.</seg>
<seg id="37">He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up chaps.</seg>
<seg id="38">Back in Berkeley, he was violently scolded by a left-wing lady friend for consorting with such people.</seg>
<seg id="39">He became angry in return.</seg>
<seg id="40">He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal "spooks" who make national security their business.</seg>
<seg id="41">At several different levels, it's a fascinating tale.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Melloan is deputy editor of the Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the Results of Parallel Audit of Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic in 2005</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="3">This material provides information on the course and results of parallel audit performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic which was concerned with the area of administration of value added tax and use of the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).</seg>
<seg id="4">In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the European Union and, consequently, income from the value added tax affects not only the State budgets of the two countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The parallel audit was concerned particularly with the procedure of tax administrators in relation to a review of the value added tax paid within commercial transactions between the individual member countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="6">Introduction of the VIES system enabled electronic exchange of information on registration of VAT payers in the individual member countries of the European Union and on commercial transactions performed by the VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Variance between information in the VIES and information stated in a value added tax return submitted by a taxpayer should alert the tax administrator to any suspicious cases and facilitate detection of tax evasions or frauds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefits of the performed parallel audit included, in addition to exchange of information on the procedure of tax offices in administration of value added tax, particularly review of the use of the VIES system within audit of exercising the entitlement to exemption from value added tax on intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="9">The findings obtained in implementation of the parallel audit support development of mutual cooperation and will be used in further parallel audits pursued in collaboration with audit institutions of the member countries of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the Results of Parallel Audit of Value Added Tax Administration for the Period from May 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Audit number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax, (SK) Audit of the procedure of tax authorities in administration, audit and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system with respect to exchange of information amongst the EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the “SAO, CR”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “SAO SR”) concluded an Agreement on Audit Cooperation on September 12, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">Under the Agreement, the parties agreed to cooperate in the performance of parallel audits entitled “Administration of value added tax”, included in the Audit Plan of the SAO, CR for 2005 under No. 05/19, and “Audit of the procedure of tax authorities in administration, audit and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system with respect to exchange of information amongst the EU Member States”, included in the Audit Plan of the SAO SR under No. 22/2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">The parallel audits had the character of a coordinated audit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The results of the joint coordinated audit were processed in the sense of European Implementing Guidelines No. 31 for the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">The aforementioned cooperation included exchange of information within the scope stipulated by the executed Agreement, as well as the preparation of a joint final report on the results of parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="19">The objective of the coordinated audit was to review selected cases of supply and acquisition of goods within suspicious commercial transactions between taxpayers of VAT in the Czech Republic (hereinafter the “CR”) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “SR”).</seg>
<seg id="20">Both Parties agreed to provide each other with information from public sources, data from the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and information on accepted and submitted requests for review of commercial transactions between the CR and the SR.</seg>
<seg id="21">Audits were performed in parallel in the period from June to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the territory of the CR, the audit was performed by the State Budget Department and by the territorial departments for Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited entities included the Ministry of Finance and 12 tax offices: Tax Office in Mladá Boleslav, Tax Office in Kolín, Tax Office in Teplice, Tax Office in Karlovy Vary, Tax Office in Tábor, Tax Office Brno III, Tax Office in Znojmo, Tax Office in Zlín, Tax Office in Šumperk, Tax Office Ostrava I, Tax Office for Prague 7 and Tax Office for Prague 9.</seg>
<seg id="24">Audit in the territory of the SR was performed by the Financial and Fiscal Section of the SAO SR, in cooperation with branch offices of the SAO SR in Banská Bystrica and Košice, at 9 selected tax offices: Tax Office Bratislava I, Tax Office Komárno, Tax Office Trenčín, Tax Office Prievidza, Tax Office Zvolen, Tax Office Dolný Kubín, Tax Office Košice II, Tax Office Košice V and Tax Office Michalovce.</seg>
<seg id="25">Objective of audits:</seg>
<seg id="26">The objective of parallel audits was to review the procedure of tax offices in administration of value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) after integration of the CR and the SR to the common internal market of the European Union (hereinafter the “EU”) and to review the use of the VIES electronic information system, particularly in audit of exercising the right to VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="27">The coordinated audit covered the period from May 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="28">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits The VIES electronic system has been introduced in the EU member countries in order to enable the tax administrators to check whether suppliers are entitled to VAT exemption of their taxable fulfilment and, in the country of destination, to review whether acquirers have duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">The VIES system is not a centralized scheme in the framework of the EU; each member country develops its own system.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit indicated differences between the national VIES systems in the CR and the SR in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="31">Values of supplies of goods to other EU member countries are stated in recapitulative statements, while the values of provided services are not included in these reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Information from recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers is processed in the CR at the level of tax offices, where this information is compared with the data on supplies of goods to other EU member countries, as stated in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tax offices forward data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the SR, data from recapitulative statements submitted by Slovak taxpayers with tax offices are merely transferred to electronic form and they are processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the SR (CLO).</seg>
<seg id="35">In the CR, taxpayers enter the value of goods supplied and the value of services provided to other EU member countries in separate lines of VAT returns, which allows for comparison of the values stated in recapitulative statements with the values of supplied goods pursuant to the VAT returns and for identification of any potential differences.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR, the values of goods supplied and services provided to other EU member countries are reported summarily in a joint line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="37">Consequently, the system in the SR does not permit automatic identification of differences between the values of supplied goods pursuant to the VAT returns and the recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="38">Separate declaration of the values of supplied goods in VAT returns allows for utilization of the results of comparison of data concerning VAT exemption of supplies to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="39">The communicated data from recapitulative statements submitted by the taxpayers in other EU member countries are processed by the CLO and compared with the acquisition values of the goods, as declared by the taxpayers from the CR or the SR in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the SR, these data are sent to the tax offices and the tax administrators themselves decide as to which differences they will subject to their review.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the CR, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which differences between the values of supplies and acquisition of goods are to be reviewed by the tax administrators and submits the list of these cases to the locally competent tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is thereby ensured that, with respect to most substantial variances, it is determined whether VAT was reported in the accurate amount upon acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">Furthermore, the audit pointed out certain problems in the system of VAT administration and complications caused by different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisition of goods by taxpayers from various EU member countries):</seg>
<seg id="44">Recapitulative statements are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the latest deadline for processing and sending data to other EU member countries is set to 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="45">Reduction of the period, for which recapitulative statements are submitted, to one month, together with shortening the time-limit for their processing, would allow earlier access to the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="46">Thus, the tax administrators would be able to review more effectively whether VAT has been reported in the correct amount with respect to intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="47">In parallel, submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same taxation period (month) would allow for faster verification as to whether the taxpayers have declared the same values of supplies of goods to the EU in the recapitulative statement and in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="48">Differences between the values of supplies of goods reported by taxpayers from the EU and the values of acquisitions of goods reported by taxpayers from the CR or SR, as appropriate, were caused, amongst other things, by variances in the methods of reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in the individual EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="49">These variances involved, for example, the specification of accepted advance payments in recapitulative statements or declaration of intra-Community supplies in the supplier’s recapitulative statement for a different quarter than for intra-Community acquisitions in the acquirer’s VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="50">Unification of the conditions for reporting of these data within the EU would increase the effectiveness of audit activities of tax administrations of the individual member countries.</seg>
<seg id="51">Cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR was also concerned with review of selected intra-Community transactions performed between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">A total of 40 commercial transactions, which took place between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities, raised doubts as regards their performance or suspicion of a tax evasion related to VAT; these transactions were checked jointly.</seg>
<seg id="53">The SAO, CR and the SAO SR ascertained, inter alia, the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="54">tax entities declared in their VAT reports intra-Community transactions that had not actually taken place, in an attempt to unlawfully obtain an excessive VAT deduction;</seg>
<seg id="55">in the framework of carousel transactions, tax entities accounted for intra-Community supplies which involved intentional several-fold reduction of the value of supplies in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions;</seg>
<seg id="56">in their VAT returns and the recapitulative statements, the suppliers declared intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to acquirers who were “missing traders” and failed to account for tax on the acquired goods;</seg>
<seg id="57">the suppliers performed intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT in favour of tax entities that were not registered for VAT in another member country.</seg>
<seg id="58">In these cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier’s country;</seg>
<seg id="59">in their VAT returns, the suppliers accounted for intra-Community supplies with a higher value than that declared by the acquirers of intra-Community acquisitions, where, in some cases, VAT was accounted for an incorrect amount.</seg>
<seg id="60">The findings obtained during the audit indicate that the VIES system provides tax administrators with information required for audit of proper application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="61">Tax administrators should pay increased attention particularly to thorough review of the differences between data declared by VAT payers and the data included in the VIES system and use of all information in tax proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="62">Aspects of value added tax after accession of the CR and the SR to the EU</seg>
<seg id="63">Value added tax</seg>
<seg id="64">On May 1, 2004, the CR and the SR became members of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="65">Internal borders and border controls of movement of goods within EU were abolished after accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="66">The competent tax office had acted as the VAT administrator until April 30, 2004; the only exception consisted in import of goods and occasional domestic bus transportation where tax had been administered by a customs office.</seg>
<seg id="67">In relation to adoption of new Czech Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”), and Slovak Act No. 222/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter “Act No. 222/2004 Coll.”), VAT administration with respect to acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU member countries was transferred from customs to tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the CR, pursuant to Section 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., supply of goods means the transfer of the right to manage goods as the owner.</seg>
<seg id="69">Supply of goods from the CR to another EU member country means a supply of goods that has actually been dispatched or transported to another EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="70">Pursuant to Section 64 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., this is an exempt taxable fulfilment with the right to deduction of VAT, provided that the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="71">In the SR, pursuant to Section 8 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., supply of goods means a supply of tangible assets involving a change in the ownership title.</seg>
<seg id="72">A supply of goods may also consist in relocation of goods that is the property of a tax entity from this country to another member state, provided that these goods are dispatched or transported by the given person or in his account to another member country for the purposes of his business activities.</seg>
<seg id="73">Pursuant to Section 43 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., a supply of goods from this country to another member state is exempt from VAT provided that the acquirer is a person identified for VAT in another EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="74">In the CR, under Section 16 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., acquisition of goods from another EU member country means the acquirement of the right to manage goods that are sent or transported to the acquirer by a person registered for VAT in another EU member country, as the owner.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Czech taxpayer buys the goods for a price excluding VAT and he is obliged to account for VAT in the CR pursuant to Section 25 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.; if the preconditions stipulated in Section 73 of the Act are met, the taxpayer incurs the right to deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the SR, under Section 11 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., acquisition of goods from another EU member country means the assumption of the right to manage movable tangible assets, which are sent or transported to the acquirer by the supplier or acquirer or in their account from this country to another member state, as the owner.</seg>
<seg id="77">The taxpayer becomes taxable in the SR upon acquisition of goods in this country from another member country pursuant to Section 20 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="78">Pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., the taxpayer may deduct VAT if he claims the tax refund upon acquisition of goods in this country from another member state pursuant to Sections 11 and 11a of the Act.</seg>
<seg id="79">Pursuant to Section 17 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and Section 45 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., as appropriate, a triangular transaction means a transaction concluded amongst three persons registered for VAT in three different EU member countries, where the subject of the transaction consists in supply of the same goods amongst these three persons.</seg>
<seg id="80">Intra-Community transactions mean supply and acquisition of goods amongst VAT payers from different EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="81">The total quantities of intra-Community transactions between the CR and the SR are set forth in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="82">The VIES system</seg>
<seg id="83">An information exchange system for the area of VAT has been established in the EU for the purposes of checking the claims for VAT exemption of intra-Community supplies of goods.</seg>
<seg id="84">It includes the VIES electronic system, which enables the tax administrators in the EU member countries to check whether the supplier was entitled to VAT exemption of a taxable fulfilment and also to review whether the acquirer has duly reported and taxed the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="85">The VIES information system is not a centralized scheme in the framework of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="86">Each member country develops its own VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="87">National systems are based on a common principle and are mutually interconnected through the Common Communication Network of the EU (CCN – see the chart below).</seg>
<seg id="88">In the CR, the VIES system has been interconnected with an Automated Tax Information System (hereinafter the “ATIS”) and, in the SR, with a Program Application of the Tax Information System (hereinafter the “PATIS”).</seg>
<seg id="89">These systems are used by tax offices as technical support for executive and management activities in administration of taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="90">International administrative cooperation</seg>
<seg id="91">Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU member country obtains information on tax entities, which it would not be able to obtain itself without such cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="92">The main objective of international administrative cooperation consists in the fight against tax evasions and tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="93">Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each member country shall designate a single administrative body entrusted with cooperation with other EU member states in administration of VAT within its internal organizational structure, the CLO (Central Liaison Office).</seg>
<seg id="94">In the CR, the tasks following from international cooperation are fulfilled by the Ministry of Finance – the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, including the newly established Department for International Cooperation in Administration of VAT (hereinafter the “MF CLO”).</seg>
<seg id="95">The functions of the CLO in the SR are performed by the Tax Directorate of the SR, the Department for International Administrative Cooperation (hereinafter the “TD CLO”).</seg>
<seg id="96">Amongst other things, these departments communicate with foreign administrations in the EU, particularly in the area of information exchange in the framework of the VIES system, spontaneous exchange of information and communication of information requested by the EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (parallel) tax audits, verification of value added tax identification numbers (hereinafter “VAT ID”) of persons registered for VAT in other EU member countries, and communicate with the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="97">For the purpose of verification of a certain intra-Community transaction or acquisition of other information related to a specific tax entity, tax offices send requests for information to the EU through the MF CLO and TD CLO, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="98">On the basis of these requests, they obtain information from the requested member countries, which they can use for proper assessing of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="99">Requests of information are sent amongst the CLOs of the EU member countries mostly in electronic form, with the use of the SCAC standardized form.</seg>
<seg id="100">Selected audit findings within verification of commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="101">Cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR was concerned particularly with review of selected intra-Community transactions between the two countries and, furthermore, with the extent of use of information obtained within international cooperation by financial and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="102">In 30 cases, the SAO, CR requested that the SAO SR reviews business transactions, which took place between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="103">The SAO SR requested in 10 cases that the SAO, CR reviews business transactions between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="104">Review of intra-Community transactions indicated, amongst other things:</seg>
<seg id="105">o</seg>
<seg id="106">The SAO, CR requested that the SAO SR reviews the procedure of the tax administrator who had been provided with a response to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="107">Through the SCAC form, the Slovak tax office asked for review of supply of goods (shoes) in the 3rd quarter of 2004 from a Slovak taxpayer in the value of SKK 2 847 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="108">A tax office of the CR responded that the Czech taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods of this value in a supplementary VAT return and supplied the same goods before the end of 2004 back to Slovak tax entities for a price of CZK 2 550 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="109">It was ascertained on the basis of international cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR that the locally competent tax office fully recognized the claim of the Slovak supplier for excessive deduction, which was incurred, inter alia, on the basis of this supply.</seg>
<seg id="110">The tax office failed to provide information on the suspected re-export to locally competent tax offices with respect to the goods transported back from the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="111">The aforementioned facts will constitute and incentive for further review of business transactions related to the potential carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="112">o</seg>
<seg id="113">With the use of the SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator asked for verification of supply of a technological unit to the SR in the value of CZK 4 850 thousand in the 2nd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="114">The tax proceedings carried out in the SR indicated that only part of the technological unit was supplied, while components in the value of CZK 3 395 thousand were not provided.</seg>
<seg id="115">When reviewing this case, the SAO SR ascertained that VAT on the taxable performance was accounted for by the Slovak tax entity from an amount of CZK 4 850 thousand in the VAT return for the taxation period of 7/2004.</seg>
<seg id="116">Furthermore, the SAO, CR ascertained that the Czech taxpayer claimed in his VAT return for the given quarter an excessive deduction of VAT in an amount of CZK 655 thousand, based on deduction of VAT on purchase of this technological unit from another domestic taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="117">On the basis of the results of investigation, the Czech tax office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax entities established a commercial relation for the purpose of unlawful obtaining of excessive deduction of VAT, challenged the taxable fulfilment and failed to recognize part of the claim for deduction of tax in an amount of CZK 647 thousand for the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="118">o</seg>
<seg id="119">In 2004, the Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that a supply of goods (copying machines) to a Czech taxpayer in the value of SKK 24 246 thousand, which took place in December 2002, be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Slovak taxpayer purchased goods in the SR in November 2002 from another tax entity for a price of SKK 29 667 thousand and, subsequently, sold it to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Slovak tax entity claimed an excessive deduction of VAT for the relevant taxation period.</seg>
<seg id="122">Tax investigation carried out in the CR indicated that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator and that it failed to submit the VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2002 and the following periods.</seg>
<seg id="123">The SAO SR ascertained that, based on the result of tax control, the Slovak tax administrator did not recognize the claim for excessive deduction in an amount of SKK 5 541 thousand as declared in the VAT return for the month of November 2002 and assessed the tax liability at SKK 1 750 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the same time, the tax entity was not granted VAT exemption based on export of goods in December 2002.</seg>
<seg id="125">o</seg>
<seg id="126">The Czech tax administrator received an instruction from the MF CLO to review the value of goods acquired during the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="127">According to information from the VIES, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods (solvents) from the SR in the value of SKK 3 767 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="128">The tax entity failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and failed to submit the VAT return, and VAT for the months of July to December 2004 was officially assessed at CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="129">The Czech tax administrator requested through the SCAC that it be reviewed whether the supplies of goods from the SR to the CR had actually taken place, in what amount and for what price (according to invoices).</seg>
<seg id="130">In response, the Slovak locally competent tax office sent a copy of the invoice, the bills of delivery and a request for payment of the invoice.</seg>
<seg id="131">The SAO SR ascertained that an exemption with the right to deduction of VAT was granted to the Slovak taxpayer for this supply.</seg>
<seg id="132">The SAO, CR ascertained that the Czech tax administrator considered the response to the request for information provided from the SR to be a piece of evidence proving that the company had acquired goods from another EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the basis of further investigation, the tax office in the CR will request that the superior body reviews the tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="134">o</seg>
<seg id="135">A Slovak company supplied goods (cardboard products), inter alia, to a U.S. company, which stored the goods in the CR in customs-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="136">The operator of the customs-free zone was identified in the invoices as the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="137">In 2004, the U.S. company, e.g., bought from the Slovak taxpayer cardboard facing materials in the value of USD 57 600 (with the unit price of 100 USD/item), which it stored in the customs-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="138">Subsequently, this company transferred the ownership title to the goods to a Swiss company for the value of USD 14 400 (unit price of 25 USD/item) and the goods were re-exported to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="139">The goods were not unloaded in the CR, but they rather left the area of the customs-free zone on the same means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="140">The Slovak tax administrator commenced tax controls at the supplier of the goods, concerned with the individual taxation periods of 2004 and 2005, based on a suspicion of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="141">Review of the performed transactions was requested from Czech locally competent tax administrators through several SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="142">The individual answers gradually provided a picture of the transactions and confirmed involvement of entities from the SR and the CR in carousel transactions.</seg>
<seg id="143">The SAO, CR, in cooperation with the SAO SR, ascertained that the value of goods was gradually reduced within these business relations.</seg>
<seg id="144">On the basis of the obtained information, the Tax Directorate of SR concluded that this case of carousel fraud included free pricing (i.e. import of undervalued goods and its overvaluation by domestic companies which are part of a chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not contrary to the Slovak VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="145">Under the current legislation, it is not possible to prevent payment of excessive deduction of VAT to export companies, as they meet all the conditions of the Act for exemption of supplies from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="146">o</seg>
<seg id="147">VAT registration of a Czech taxpayer was cancelled as of July 12, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="148">On October 27, 2005, this entity again became a VAT payer on the basis of a voluntary application for VAT registration.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the VAT return for the month of August 2005 (i.e. the period when it was not a VAT payer), the Czech tax entity stated the value of acquisition of goods (a printing machine) from the SR in the amount of CZK 1 174 thousand and claimed deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="150">This value corresponded to the supply of goods from the Slovak taxpayer in an amount of SKK 1 530 thousand, which was stated by the Slovak taxpayer in his VAT return as supply of goods to another EU member country with the right to deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="151">The Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that the aforementioned supply would be reviewed, as the Slovak supplier failed to prove the manner of acquisition of the goods supplied to the CR.</seg>
<seg id="152">The SAO, CR ascertained that the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and that it was not present at the address registered in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="153">In the framework of international exchange of information, the locally competent tax administrator in the CR will perform local investigation in order to verify the data.</seg>
<seg id="154">o</seg>
<seg id="155">In the recapitulative statement for the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Slovak taxpayer stated supplies of goods in the value of SKK 956 thousand to a tax entity in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="156">The VAT ID of the Czech entity was incorrect according to the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="157">By review of the database of taxpayers, it was ascertained that the relevant VAT ID had never been assigned in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="158">According to invoices issued by the Slovak taxpayer, the subject of the performance consisted in electrical engineering work at a real estate in the CR; rather than supply of goods from the SR to the CR, a provision of services was involved.</seg>
<seg id="159">The services were invoiced excluding VAT, as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it was registered in the CR as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="160">The Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that the aforementioned facts would be verified.</seg>
<seg id="161">By inquiry at the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO, CR ascertained that the tax entity which was identified in the invoices as the client had never been registered in the CR as a VAT payer, that it failed to account for the tax on services accepted from the Slovak entity and that it also failed to account for the tax on acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="162">Neither local investigation nor tax control has been performed at the Czech entity, as its current location is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="163">On the basis of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that, by acceptance of the service, the Czech tax entity became a VAT payer by operation of law.</seg>
<seg id="164">Tax control concerned with the period of the 1st to 4th quarters of 2004 will be carried out at the Slovak tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="165">o</seg>
<seg id="166">In the recapitulative statement for the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Slovak taxpayer stated supplies of goods in the value of SKK 1 055 thousand to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="167">According to invoices issued by the Slovak taxpayer, the subject of the performance consisted in electrical engineering work at a property in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="168">Rather than supply of goods from the SR to the CR, the subject of the performance involved provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that the aforementioned facts would be verified.</seg>
<seg id="170">By inquiry at the locally competent tax administrator in the CR, the SAO, CR ascertained that, at the time of the supply, the Czech entity was a VAT payer, and local investigation was carried out at the taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004 for the purpose of review of acquisition of goods from other EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="171">On the basis of the local investigation, it was ascertained that, rather than acquisition of goods, the given transaction involved acquisition of services, as stated by the Czech entity in the ordinary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="172">Furthermore, the tax office ascertained that, due to incorrect procedure in calculation of VAT, the Czech entity did not pay VAT for the 3rd quarter of 2004 in the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="173">The tax entity shall submit a supplementary VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="174">By inquiry at the locally competent tax office, the SAO SR ascertained that the Slovak taxpayer incorrectly stated the provision of services in the recapitulative statement and tax control will be carried out at that entity for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="175">o</seg>
<seg id="176">A Czech tax entity voluntarily registered as a VAT payer as of March 10, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="177">For the 1st quarter of 2004, it submitted a VAT return with a high input and output turnover.</seg>
<seg id="178">The locally competent tax administrator commenced tax proceedings, where the entity failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and, therefore, VAT was assessed in the amount of CZK 0 given the suspected involvement in carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="179">The taxpayer did not submit any further VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="180">For the purpose of non-fulfilment of obligations following from the Act, its VAT registration was cancelled as of January 4, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="181">According to information from the VIES system, this entity acquired goods in the value of SKK 7 846 thousand from a Slovak taxpayer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="182">For the purpose of reviewing the performance of these transactions, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">By inquiry at the locally competent tax office, the SAO SR ascertained that the executive of the Czech company denied, in his testimony, that the reviewed transactions actually took place and contested the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.</seg>
<seg id="184">The intra-Community supply to the CR, as reported by the Slovak taxpayer, was challenged on the basis of tax proceedings performed in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="185">The taxpayer’s claim for VAT exemption will not be recognized and VAT will be assessed on the aforementioned amount.</seg>
<seg id="186">o</seg>
<seg id="187">According to information from the VIES system, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods (working clothes) from the SR in the total value of SKK 39 970 thousand in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="188">In that quarter, the Czech taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods from another EU member country only in the VAT return for the month of March 2005, in the value of CZK 11 292 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="189">The locally competent tax administrator performed local investigation of the relevant entity, aimed at reviewing data stated in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="190">As the company failed to submit any documents or otherwise prove the taxable fulfilments, on June 9, 2005, the tax administrator assessed VAT in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="191">Given the doubts regarding the actual acquisition of goods, in May 2005, the tax administrator sent two requests for information to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="192">According to the response to the requests for information, the tax administrator in the SR had doubts as regards the performance of the transactions, as well as the payment.</seg>
<seg id="193">The SAO SR stated that the Slovak tax administrator sent to the TD CLO instigation to perform simultaneous audits, together with the tax administration of the CR, which will be carried out at the participating entities.</seg>
<seg id="194">At the time of the coordinated audit, the locally competent tax administrator in the CR performed another investigation concerning the Czech entity and, at the same time, investigation was being pursued by the Police of the CR.</seg>
<seg id="195">o</seg>
<seg id="196">The following 2 cases are concerned with companies that are suspected of being involved in a carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="197">Transactions with goods (working clothes) were implemented between the CR and SR in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="198">Slovak taxpayer No. 1 supplied the goods to Czech taxpayer No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="199">Then, the goods were sold in the CR to taxpayer No. 3 who sent them back to the SR to taxpayer No. 4 (see Chart No. 2).</seg>
<seg id="200">A)</seg>
<seg id="201">Czech taxpayer No. 2 allegedly acquired from Slovak taxpayer No. 1 goods (working clothes) in the value of CZK 4 847 thousand in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods in the value of CZK 17 050 thousand in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="202">Given the fact that the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return did not correspond to data in the VIES system, on May 25, 2005, the locally competent tax administrator sent a request for information to the SR.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the response, the Slovak tax administrator expressed his doubts regarding the performance of the transactions and provision of payment.</seg>
<seg id="204">A request for information concerning goods in the value of SKK 16 575 thousand, which were allegedly supplied by Slovak taxpayer No. 1 to Czech taxpayer No. 2 in December 2004, was delivered to the MF CLO from the SR on June 8, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="205">The Slovak party requested that it would be reviewed whether Czech taxpayer No. 2 actually received the goods, accounted for them in the VAT return and paid VAT.</seg>
<seg id="206">The official record drawn up by the locally competent tax administrator in the CR indicates that Czech taxpayer No. 2 had not been present at the address registered in the Commercial Register for a prolonged period of time.</seg>
<seg id="207">Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly taxation period, he submitted VAT return for quarterly taxation periods.</seg>
<seg id="208">Given this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not assess VAT.</seg>
<seg id="209">The taxable fulfilment between Slovak taxpayer No. 1 and Czech taxpayer No. 2 in the amount of SKK 16 575 thousand, as stated in the request, could not be reviewed for the aforementioned reasons.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech tax administrator had suspicion of involvement of both entities in a carousel fraud aimed at claiming an excessive deduction of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="211">B)</seg>
<seg id="212">Czech taxpayer No. 3, whose object of activities includes purchase and sale of cars, submitted a VAT return for the taxation periods of January and February 2005, in which he accounted for supplies of goods (working clothes) to Slovak taxpayer No. 4 in an overall value of CZK 21 935 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="213">These working clothes were allegedly bought by Czech taxpayer No. 3 from Czech taxpayer No. 2 in the period from December 2004 to January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="214">The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to the SR, concerning particularly review as to whether Slovak taxpayer No. 4 acquired from Czech taxpayer No. 3 goods in the value of CZK 1 025 thousand in December 2004 and goods in the value of CZK 21 935 thousand in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="215">The response from the SR to this request for information indicated that, in the VAT return for the month of December 2004, Slovak taxpayer No. 4 declared a zero value of goods acquired from another EU member country and, in the VAT return for the months of January and February 2005, declared the value of goods acquired from another EU member country only in the amount of SKK 1 193 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="216">Slovak taxpayer No. 4 did not respond to the request for submission of tax documents for the taxation periods of October 2004 to March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">During local investigation performed in the SR, it was ascertained that the company was not present at the address specified in the Commercial Register.</seg>
<seg id="218">In the response, it was also stated that the taxpayer met all the characteristics of a “missing trader” and, therefore, there was a justified suspicion of a carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="219">The SAO SR stated that the Slovak tax administrator sent to the TD CLO instigation to perform simultaneous audits, together with the tax administration of the CR, which will be carried out at the participating tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="220">During the coordinated audit, the Czech tax administrator collected basic documents confirming or denying the existence of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="221">VAT will be assessed according to the results of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">The case is also being dealt with by the Police of the CR.</seg>
<seg id="223">Audit procedure</seg>
<seg id="224">In the framework of preparation of parallel audits, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, CR and representatives of the SAO SR was held in the first half of the month of July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="225">The participants of the meeting discussed the legislation on VAT in both countries and introduction of the VIES electronic system to national databases.</seg>
<seg id="226">The meeting resulted in specification of the scope of cooperation and stipulating the conditions for selection of audit samples.</seg>
<seg id="227">Both parties agreed that cooperation should concentrate on the following areas: a) review of validity and correctness of the VAT IDs of persons registered for VAT in the CR or SR, as appropriate, in intra-Community supplies; b) review of data on intra-Community acquisitions stated in the VAT returns by taxpayers in the CR with the use of information from recapitulative statement (hereinafter the “RS”) of taxpayers from the SR contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the CR and in the SR with respect to the performed transactions.</seg>
<seg id="228">Furthermore, it was agreed that selection of tax entities for audit would be carried out on the basis of the quantity of intra-Community supplies between the CR and the SR and, according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and accepted between the CR and the SR through the SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="229">5.1 Intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="230">The procedure in processing of information between tax administrations of the CR and the SR in intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods is depicted in the following chart.</seg>
<seg id="231">5.1.1 Intra-Community supplies</seg>
<seg id="232">If a VAT payer makes an intra-Community supply, he is obliged to submit a RS by the 25th day after expiry of the relevant calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="233">In the RS, a taxpayer in the CR provides summary information on supplies of goods to another EU member countries exempt from VAT, which he carried out during the previous calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="234">In the SR a taxpayer is obliged to declare in the RS the value of goods exempt from VAT and supplied to this country from other EU member countries during a calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="235">Information on the value of supplied goods is stated in the RS always in the Czech or Slovak currency, as appropriate, and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they were registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="236">Data on services are not provided in the RS.</seg>
<seg id="237">If a taxpayer in the CR finds out that he has stated incorrect information in the RS, he is obliged to submit a corrective RS.</seg>
<seg id="238">If a taxpayer in the SR finds out that the data stated in the RS were incomplete or incorrect, this taxpayer shall submit a corrective RS prior to expiry of the deadline for submission of the RS; after this deadline, he shall submit a supplementary RS.</seg>
<seg id="239">The VIES system allows for exchange of information on registration data of taxpayers registered for VAT in the EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="240">Taxpayers from the CR and the SR may verify whether the VAT ID of the relevant acquirer is registered in the given EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="241">Information from the submitted RS are combined at the MF CLO and TD CLO, as appropriate, with the use of the VIES system according to the individual VAT IDs of the acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="242">The summary value of all supplies is calculated for each acquirer’s VAT ID and the codes of the manner of fulfilment are drawn up for all Czech and Slovak suppliers in the so-called L1QD files.</seg>
<seg id="243">Data from the L1QD files are sent to the relevant EU member countries at the latest within three months of the end of the quarter to which the data are related.</seg>
<seg id="244">The total value of intra-Community fulfilments between the CR and the SR (from L1QD files) is stated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="245">If the VIES system in another member country detects an incorrect acquirer’s VAT ID in the sent L1QD files, it generates the “O_MCTL” report which contains all false VAT IDs with description of the type of error.</seg>
<seg id="246">This report is subsequently sent to the MF CLO or TD CLO, as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="247">The O_MCTL may contain 4 types of mistakes: formally incorrect VAT ID; the VAT ID is not recorded in the given country or has never been assigned; the acquirer with a certain VAT ID was not a VAT payer in the given quarter; VAT registration of the acquirer was cancelled during the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="248">In the CR, the MF CLO submits data from accepted O_MCTL reports to the tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="249">If a false VAT ID of a taxpayer from the EU is entered in any of the lines of the RS or corrective RS, the ATIS system at the competent tax office generates a “Notice of Doubt Concerning VAT ID”.</seg>
<seg id="250">The tax office reviews whether the supply to a taxpayer registered for VAT in another EU member country has actually taken place and records the result of review in the system.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the SR, the TD CLO processes all O_MCTL reports in the VIES system and sends them to the locally competent tax offices together with identification of taxpayers who stated a false VAT ID in the RS.</seg>
<seg id="252">Tax offices subsequently invite the taxpayers to submit supplementary RS and state valid VAT IDs or, in case of reporting an invalid VAT ID in the submitted RS, the tax office reviews the supply of goods at the relevant taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="253">Information on the number of false VAT IDs related to intra-Community transactions performed between the CR and the SR is stated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="254">Of the total number of 41 728 VAT IDs of Czech taxpayers stated in the RS submitted by Slovak taxpayers in the period from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, 929 VAT IDs, i.e. 2.23 %, were incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="255">Of the total number of 62 997 VAT IDs of Slovak taxpayers stated in the RS by the Czech taxpayers in the same period, 416 VAT IDs, i.e. 0.66 %, were incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="256">When accounting for intra-Community transactions performed between the CR and the SR, Czech taxpayers stated fewer false VAT IDs in their RS than taxpayers from the SR.</seg>
<seg id="257">When reviewing the activities of tax offices, as appropriate, it was ascertained that the VIES system did not always provide up-to-date information on validity of VAT registration of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="258">E.g.:</seg>
<seg id="259">- although, on the basis of inquiry by a tax administrator in the CR, the VIES system confirmed validity of registration of a tax entity in the 4th quarter of 2004, an O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to cancelling of registration of the taxpayer during this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="260">Investigation showed that the registration was cancelled only as of January 1, 2005;</seg>
<seg id="261">- furthermore, the SAO SR ascertained that 6 tax entities submitted a RS containing false VAT IDs; however, the O_MCTL reports did not contain these VAT IDs.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the SR, the submitted RS are transferred by the tax offices into electronic form and data from the RS are sent to the TD CLO.</seg>
<seg id="263">After subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, the TD CLO sends to the competent tax offices the so-called lists of errors in the RS submitted by tax entities for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="264">The SAO SR compared information on erroneous data in the RS as of July 26, 2005 (i.e. information processed prior to commencement of audit) with information as of February 2, 2006 (i.e. data processed after completion of audit).</seg>
<seg id="265">Comparison of the data is given in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="266">The above data indicate that the audit carried out by the SAO SR led not only to a decrease in the number of RS with an incorrect VAT ID (on average, by 199 RS per quarter), but also to a decrease in the number of uncorrected mistakes in the RS (on average, by 431 mistakes per quarter).</seg>
<seg id="267">In the CR, tax offices compare the value of intra-Community supplies, as declared by the taxpayers in the relevant lines of the VAT return, with the value of intra-Community supplies set forth by the taxpayers in the quarterly RS.</seg>
<seg id="268">The ATIS system automatically indicates differences between these values.</seg>
<seg id="269">The tax administrator should verify these differences, remedy any shortcomings and use the obtained data when determining the tax obligation.</seg>
<seg id="270">The SAO, CR ascertained that the audited tax offices failed to review these differences in 27 cases.</seg>
<seg id="271">The total difference between the values stated in the RS and the VAT return equalled in these cases CZK 537 231 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="272">From the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ATIS system has enabled the tax administrators in the CR to consider any values declared in the RS and the VAT return which differ by an amount not exceeding 0.5 % of the total value of intra-Community supplies pursuant to the RS to be equal values and set such conformity in the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="273">For taxpayers with a large quantity of intra-Community supplies during a quarter, 0.5 % is not a negligible amount and, therefore, in these cases, tax administrators should not set conformity of RS and VAT return without clarifying the causes of the differences.</seg>
<seg id="274">E.g., the tax administrator set conformity in case of values differing by CZK 1 561 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="275">Review of differences in the CR and the SR was complicated by the fact that the RS per each quarter was submitted by the taxpayers within 25 days after expiry of the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="276">For taxpayers with a monthly taxation period, tax administrators could not compare the values of intra-Community supplies in the VAT return with the values pursuant to the RS at the time of submitting the VAT return for the first two months of the calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="277">In these cases, the tax administrators learned of the potential inconsistence of data in the VAT return with the data in the RS only at a time when the tax liability or the excessive deduction of VAT was assessed or reimbursed, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="278">5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisitions</seg>
<seg id="279">The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-Community transactions performed in the framework of the EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="280">Acquisition of goods in the CR</seg>
<seg id="281">Data from the RS submitted by taxpayers from other EU member countries (delivered L1QD) are processed in the CR by the MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="282">During processing, these data are converted on the basis of minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant quarter and then they are compared with the acquisition value stated by the Czech taxpayers in the VAT return for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="283">The acquisition value declared by the taxpayers in the VAT return should vary between the minimum and maximum converted values of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).</seg>
<seg id="284">When the value declared in the VAT return is lower than L1min, a “review instruction” is generated for taxpayers with the most substantial variances.</seg>
<seg id="285">Instructions to review acquisitions of goods serve as a notice to problematic tax entities and are submitted to locally competent tax offices, which must examine the submitted data.</seg>
<seg id="286">The numbers of review instructions concerning audited tax offices in the CR are stated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="287">The SAO, CR ascertained that, in 33 cases, the audited tax offices failed to review variances in the values of intra-Community acquisitions that were indicated by the delivered review instructions.</seg>
<seg id="288">The total difference between the values stated in the RS submitted by taxpayers from other EU member countries and the VAT returns submitted by the Czech taxpayers equalled in these cases at least CZK 148 319 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="289">The SAO, CR selected for audit 533 files of tax entities, with respect to which the audited tax offices received a review instruction from the MF CLO.</seg>
<seg id="290">The audit indicated the following most frequent causes of differences between the values stated in the acquirer’s VAT return and the supplier’s RS: on the part of the acquirer (Czech taxpayer) in 263 cases, the acquirer failed to state the acquisition of goods in the ordinary VAT return, in 93 cases, the taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods in a taxation period other than in which he was obliged to account for the tax, in 6 cases, the acquirer stated the value of acquired goods in an incorrect line of the VAT return, on the part of the supplier (taxpayer from the EU) in 88 cases, taxpayers from the EU included in their RS also values of services provided to a Czech taxpayer, of which 54 cases involved taxpayers from the SR, in 39 cases, the taxpayers included in their RS supplies of goods in a different taxation period than acquirers from the CR in their VAT return, in 22 cases, the suppliers stated in their RS an incorrect VAT ID of the Czech taxpayer, in 16 cases, the suppliers stated incorrect values of supplies of goods in the RS, in 12 cases, the suppliers included in the RS the value of goods supplied to the CR before May 1, 2004, in 5 cases, the suppliers included in the RS the value of accepted advance payments.</seg>
<seg id="291">Slovak taxpayers most frequently incorrectly declared in the RS the value of provided services.</seg>
<seg id="292">54 such cases were found at the audited tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="293">E.g., during examination of a review instruction, it was ascertained that a difference of CZK 10 974 thousand was caused by the fact that the Slovak taxpayer included in the RS for the 1st quarter of 2005 the provision of services (construction work and supply of goods including assembly in the territory of the CR).</seg>
<seg id="294">Another reason for the existence of differences consisted in inclusion of values of accepted advance payments in the RS; e.g., 2 Slovak taxpayers included in their RS advance payments accepted from Czech taxpayers, resulting in generating a review instruction concerning a difference of CZK 3 580 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="295">Review instructions concerning acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.</seg>
<seg id="296">In case of a subsequent change in the data declared in the RS in the EU member countries, such as a change in the buyer of goods in the CR or an increase in the value of goods supplied to the CR, no new review instructions are generated.</seg>
<seg id="297">Given the fact that the VIES system does not provide automatic notification of these changes, without further information the locally competent tax administrator for the acquirer of the goods may not learn of the facts decisive for correct assessment of the tax obligation concerning the acquired goods and the probability of VAT fraud is very high.</seg>
<seg id="298">The audit performed by the SAO, CR indicated that this situation occurred, e.g. in the following cases:</seg>
<seg id="299">A Slovak taxpayer stated in the RS for the 2nd quarter of 2004 the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer equal to SKK 1 504 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="300">On February 1, 2005, the locally competent tax office for the Czech taxpayer sent a request for information to the SR, as the Czech taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods only in the amount of CZK 425 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="301">On the basis of tax proceedings, on March 1, 2005, the Slovak taxpayer submitted a supplementary RS, in which he corrected data on supply of goods to the CR, namely by decreasing the value of the supply to the original Czech taxpayer to SKK 538 thousand and increasing the value of goods supplied to another Czech taxpayer from SKK 194 thousand to the value of SKK 1 160 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="302">Four Slovak taxpayers stated in their RS for the 2nd quarter of 2004 intra-Community supplies to taxpayers from the CR in a total amount of SKK 10 240 thousand (i.e. CZK 8 183 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="303">However, Czech taxpayers did not account for intra-Community acquisitions in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="304">On the basis of international exchange of information, it was ascertained that, in all cases, the goods were supplied to another Czech taxpayer who was not identified in the RS submitted by the Slovak taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="305">During the 1st quarter of 2005, Slovak taxpayers increased the value of intra-Community supplies to this Czech taxpayer declared in the supplementary RS concerning the 2nd quarter of 2004, by a total of SKK 10 240 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="306">Given the aforementioned facts, the locally competent tax administrator in the CR could not have any doubt concerning correctness of data stated in the submitted VAT return for the 2nd quarter of 2004, although the actual acquirer failed to fulfil the obligation to account for an intra-Community acquisition during this quarter.</seg>
<seg id="307">The SAO, CR ascertained that, on the basis of international exchange of information between tax administrations, VAT was subsequently assessed for the Czech taxpayer in an amount of CZK 3 640 thousand for the taxation periods of May and June 2004 and in an amount of CZK 3 305 thousand for the 3rd quarter of 2004 with respect to the goods acquired in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="308">It follows from the aforementioned facts that tax administrators had to review in tax proceedings not only differences arisen due to errors in the acquirer’s VAT return, but also differences caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in the individual EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="309">Unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would increase the effectiveness of control activities of tax administrators.</seg>
<seg id="310">Acquisition of goods in the SR</seg>
<seg id="311">In the SR, the PATIS system allows for comparison of data on the value of acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU member countries with data set forth in the VAT returns submitted by Slovak acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="312">The method of comparison of data is called the “MIN-MAX method”.</seg>
<seg id="313">This method is used to convert the values of acquisitions stated in the RS of taxpayers from other EU member countries on the basis of the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.</seg>
<seg id="314">A MIN-MAX interval is thus established, which is used to compare the values of acquisitions stated in the VAT returns submitted by Slovak taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="315">The TD CLO provides the tax administrators with information on values of intra-Community acquisitions stated in the VAT returns and values of supplies from the EU in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrator decides with respect to which persons registered for VAT this difference will be reviewed, taking also account of other risk analysis criteria.</seg>
<seg id="317">On the basis of data provided by the TD CLO, the SAO SR collected at the audited tax offices 57 files of Slovak acquirers of goods for audit, of which 25 taxpayers acquired goods from the CR, and, with respect to these acquirers, the greatest differences were established between the values of acquisition obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in the VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="318">Audit performed by the SAO SR confirmed the fact that tax administrators failed to consistently review differences established through the MIN-MAX method and thus failed to verify accuracy of data declared in the VAT returns by Slovak acquirers.</seg>
<seg id="319">In the framework of audit, the SAO SR requested that the tax offices carry out 47 local investigations concerned with specific tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="320">31 local investigations were completed at tax offices during the audit by the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="321">The following facts were ascertained, inter alia, with respect to Slovak companies, in relation to which the VIES system reported considerable differences in the MIN-MAX values upon acquisition of goods from the EU member countries:</seg>
<seg id="322">In the VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, a Slovak taxpayer failed to declare the value of goods acquired from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="323">The tax office ascertained that a company from the CR declared by mistake in the RS for the 4th quarter of 2004 the number of the aforementioned taxpayer, while the goods in the value of CZK 19 184 thousand were in fact supplied to a different Slovak taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="324">According to the VIES system, a Slovak company allegedly acquired goods from the CR, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the MIN value of SKK 682 692 thousand and in the MAX value of SKK 715 105 thousand during the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="325">This company submitted a VAT return for the given period, in which it declared the value of acquisitions from the EU only in the amount of SKK 480 599 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="326">The tax administrator carried out local investigations, in which it ascertained that the tax entity purchased electrical energy from the CR, Poland, Hungary and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="327">Suppliers declared in the RS and the VAT return intra-Community supplies according to the date of delivery, rather than according to the dates of issuance of invoices.</seg>
<seg id="328">Given other variances in acquisition of goods from those EU member countries, the tax administrator will request review of the value of supplied goods through the SCAC forms.</seg>
<seg id="329">A Slovak taxpayer failed to state in the VAT return acquisition of goods from other EU member countries in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the VIES system, this taxpayer allegedly acquired goods in the MIN value of SKK 11 286 thousand and in the MAX value of SKK 11 845 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="331">The tax office carried out local investigation and the audit indicated that the tax entity did not acquire any goods from the EU member countries in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="332">The SAO SR recommended the tax office to request through the SCAC form that the supply of goods from the EU member countries would be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="333">Supply of goods for a Slovak buyer in the MIN value of SKK 557 thousand and in the MAX value of SKK 565 thousand was recorded in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="334">In the VAT return for the taxation period of October to December 2004, the taxpayer did not account for any acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="335">By local investigation, the tax administrator ascertained that, on December 10, 2004, the tax entity received from a supplier in the CR an invoice for material used in repair of a hydraulic loader.</seg>
<seg id="336">The SAO SR recommended that a tax control would be performed at the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="337">16 local investigations were not completed at tax offices during the audit by the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="338">In 10 cases, the SAO SR requested that the tax administrators perform tax control at the tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="339">Reports on the results of local investigations and tax controls will be lodged by the tax authorities after their performance to the SAO SR.</seg>
<seg id="340">The following cases were involved, for example:</seg>
<seg id="341">A Slovak acquirer failed to declare in the VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004 an acquisition of goods from EU member countries and, for the taxation period of October to December 2004, he failed to account for any tax and claimed reimbursement of an excessive deduction of VAT in a total amount of SKK 1 236 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="342">The tax administrator carried out local investigation, which indicated that the tax entity acquired goods from the CR in the value of EUR 683 thousand (approx. SKK 27 080 thousand).</seg>
<seg id="343">The aforementioned goods were transported from the CR by the Czech supplier to the customs office in Čierna nad Tisou, where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="344">The Slovak taxpayer issued an invoice to the buyer in the Russian Federation in an amount of EUR 683 thousand, which he failed to declare in the submitted VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="345">The tax administrator is performing tax control at the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="346">The difference between the data on acquisition stated in the VAT return submitted by the Slovak taxpayer for the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005 and the data on supplies accounted for by the taxpayers from the EU member countries in the individual quarters equalled a total of SKK 4 800 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="347">The tax office ascertained that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers in the CR and Belgium and subsequently sold the goods to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="348">Uniform export customs declarations were attached to the invoices.</seg>
<seg id="349">The tax entity did not state the acquisition of goods in the VAT return; according to the statement of the executive of the company, the goods were transported within the transit procedure directly from the CR to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="350">The tax entity did not submit any VAT records during local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="351">Tax control was commenced at the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="352">5.2 International exchange of information at the L3 level</seg>
<seg id="353">Information exchange at the L3 level is initiated by locally competent tax administrators who send their requests for information (hereinafter “RFI”) or spontaneous information exchange (hereinafter “SIE”) related to a certain tax entity or transaction through the MF CLO or TD CLO, as appropriate, to other EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="354">The objective of the RFI is, e.g. to demonstrate performance of a given transaction in the framework of intra-Community performances, verification of a certain VAT ID, etc.</seg>
<seg id="355">SIE involves provision of information that is important for a tax administrator in another EU member country.</seg>
<seg id="356">Cooperation in the area of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="357">Pursuant to Art. 8 of the Regulation, the limit for response to a RFI equals 3 months.</seg>
<seg id="358">The conditions for admissibility of requests are regulated in the Commission Decision of November 15, 2004 which stipulates that, unless the countries involved agree otherwise, the RFI must concern transactions with a value of at least EUR 1 500 excl. VAT.</seg>
<seg id="359">If a RFI concerns a transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excl. VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond with respect to its workload.</seg>
<seg id="360">The procedure in dealing with received RFI by the tax administration of the CR, including specification of internal time limits stipulated for processing at individual organizational levels, is depicted in the following chart.</seg>
<seg id="361">In the SR, the time limit for responding to a RFI by the tax offices was internally set at 2 months so that the three-month limit pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 can be complied with.</seg>
<seg id="362">The MF CLO received a total of 29 RFI and 3 SIEs from the SR in the period from May 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="363">Of 29 RFI received, 26 (i.e. 89.7 %) were dealt with within the set deadline of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3 %) were dealt with after the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="364">During the same period, the TD CLO received a total of 71 RFI and 7 SIE from the CR.</seg>
<seg id="365">Of 71 RFI received, 64 (i.e. 90.1 %) were dealt with within the set deadline of 3 months and 5 (i.e. 7.0 %) were dealt with after the deadline (in 2 remaining cases, it was not possible to determine the deadline on the basis of the submitted materials).</seg>
<seg id="366">More detailed information on the duration of addressing RFI accepted by the MF CLO or TD CLO, as appropriate, is given in Graph No. 1.</seg>
<seg id="367">The reasons for sending RFI, as stated in the SCAC forms, are described in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="368">Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="369">On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax was reviewed, as well as the use of the VIES system to exchange information amongst EU member countries, particularly in control of exercising the claim for VAT exemption.</seg>
<seg id="370">International cooperation enabled to verify selected intra-Community transactions performed between VAT payers from the CR and the SR.</seg>
<seg id="371">Review of selected transactions indicated that, on the basis of international exchange of information, tax administrations of both countries revealed that certain companies performed fictitious intra-Community transactions in order to obtain excessive deductions of VAT and also that certain acquirers failed to account for VAT on accepted supplies of goods in the correct amount.</seg>
<seg id="372">The audit also revealed variances in processing and use of data from the VIES system by tax administrations of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="373">Moreover, the audit also indicated problems caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods in individual EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="374">Unification of the conditions for reporting of these data within the EU would increase the effectiveness of control activities of tax administrations of the individual member countries.</seg>
<seg id="375">Through review of the procedure of tax offices in administration of VAT and use of the VIES system, it was ascertained that tax offices did not adequately utilize all the options of the VIES system and the relevant statutory powers.</seg>
<seg id="376">Furthermore, it was ascertained that the VIES system did not always provide up-to-date information on supplies of goods and on validity of registration of tax entities for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="377">The SAO SR compared data on occurrence of erroneous data in the RS processed prior to commencement of audit with data processed after completion of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="378">It follows from the comparison of these data that audit by the SAO SR led, not only to reduction of the number of RS with incorrect VAT ID, but also to reduction of the number of uncorrected mistakes in the RS.</seg>
<seg id="379">In case of variances in the reported data, the SAO SR requested that the tax offices perform local investigations or tax control, as appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="380">The SAO, CR did not have that option in the framework of the valid legislation in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="381">The findings obtained during the audit indicate that the VIES system provided tax administrators with basic information required for control of proper application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="382">Given the fact that there continues to be a potential for tax evasions in this area, it is necessary to pay increased attention to intra-Community transactions in administration of VAT.</seg>

<seg id="1">Your Oct. 6 editorial "The Ill Homeless" referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="2">Your comments implied we had discovered that the "principal cause" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.</seg>
<seg id="3">We have made no such statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless.</seg>
<seg id="5">The "causes" of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case.</seg>
<seg id="6">In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism.</seg>
<seg id="7">You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.</seg>
<seg id="8">They suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape.</seg>
<seg id="9">Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy and shelter, they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition, cleanliness and basic health care.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness, others may be a consequence of it, and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter.</seg>
<seg id="11">The interactions between health and homelessness are complex, defying sweeping generalizations as to "cause" or "effect."</seg>
<seg id="12">If we look to the future, preventing homelessness is an important objective.</seg>
<seg id="13">This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess, an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research.</seg>

<seg id="20">A study by Tulane Prof.</seg>
<seg id="21">James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems, with the common thread of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="22">The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Dr. Wright, homelessness is "simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level."</seg>

<seg id="29">After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation, you're scarcely in touch with reality any more; without psychiatric treatment, you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the homeless, obviously, had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.</seg>
<seg id="31">But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets.</seg>
<seg id="32">Once there, what ways of escape are open to them other than drink, drugs or insanity?</seg>
<seg id="33">Maxwell R.D. Vos</seg>
<seg id="34">Brooklyn, N.Y.</seg>
<seg id="35">You dismiss as "sentimental" the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77% might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years.</seg>
<seg id="36">There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic: namely, that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness.</seg>
<seg id="37">Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made.</seg>
<seg id="38">Robert S. Jenkins</seg>
<seg id="39">Cambridge, Mass.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless, you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that "know a good thing when they see it," and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.</seg>
<seg id="41">But isn't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to, and advertise in, your paper?</seg>
<seg id="42">Why didn't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march?</seg>
<seg id="43">As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations, I suggest you conduct your own survey.</seg>
<seg id="44">Choose 203 business executives, including, perhaps, someone from your own staff, and put them out on the streets, to be deprived for one month of their homes, families and income.</seg>
<seg id="45">I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their "normal" phobias, anxieties, depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically.</seg>

<seg id="1">Abortion-rights advocates won last week's battles, but the war over the nation's most-contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions.</seg>
<seg id="2">Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week, with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard.</seg>
<seg id="4">The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months: the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude, and the ability of each side to counter the other's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">The action in Pennsylvania, for example, will follow last week's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state, and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.</seg>
<seg id="6">But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that, along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure, is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's great to feel good for once in 15 years," says Harrison Hickman, a consultant to abortion-rights advocates, reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week's victories, the first major events since the Supreme Court, in its July 3 Webster decision, permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions. "But how many more times we're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question."</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests. "The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize," says Glen Halva-Neubauer, a Furman University political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question. "But it still hasn't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri, where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it's been an emotional issue for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="9">The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania, where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature doesn't reflect the viewpoints of the state's citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County, the legislature's leading foe of abortion, has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and, he hopes, to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v.</seg>
<seg id="11">Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Freind legislation -- the state's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, except to avert the death of the mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Freind calculates that the provision, which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established, will "make it necessary" for the Supreme Court to review Roe and, perhaps, to overturn it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an "informed consent" provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="15">Under this legislation, a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion," Mr. Freind argues, "it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which, one way or the other, might remain with her for the rest of her life."</seg>
<seg id="17">In Michigan, where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week, Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists.</seg>
<seg id="18">Susan Rogin, a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state, takes comfort from the fact that the state's House abortion opponents "haven't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years." But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents' rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Illinois, lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age, weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that, if fetuses survive an abortion, a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive.</seg>
<seg id="20">The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday, but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pamela Sutherland, executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, says she and her allies are "cautiously optimistic" they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abortion foes in Wisconsin, meanwhile, expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Texas, abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds, personnel and facilities for abortion, and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older.</seg>
<seg id="24">The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The prognosis is only fair," says Kathie Roberts, administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee. "Next year is an election year and the legislators just don't want to do anything about this now."</seg>
<seg id="26">This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts, plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, and girding for next autumn's state elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy, deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan, the National Right to Life Committee's director of state organizational development, calls "reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support." These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection, and the public funding of alternatives for abortion. "Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves 'pro-choice' rather than `pro-abortion, '" says Mary Spaulding, the group's associate state legislative coordinator.</seg>
<seg id="28">Over the weekend, the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians, including Pennsylvania's Mr. Freind, as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques, including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures. "We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time," says Kate Michelman, executive director of the group.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US</seg>
<seg id="2">As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.</seg>
<seg id="10">Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="11">As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="12">Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.</seg>
<seg id="14">Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.</seg>
<seg id="15">The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.</seg>
<seg id="17">This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="20">October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.</seg>
<seg id="24">Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.</seg>
<seg id="25">Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="26">New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our long term climate forecast is indicating high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.</seg>
<seg id="8">Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.</seg>
<seg id="9">And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.</seg>
<seg id="12">ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="13">CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Interest remained high after the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?</seg>
<seg id="20">He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""</seg>
<seg id="21">Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.</seg>
<seg id="24">Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.</seg>
<seg id="25">After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.</seg>
<seg id="26">Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.</seg>

<seg id="1">Although his team lost the World Series, San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them.</seg>
<seg id="2">He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park.</seg>
<seg id="3">Small wonder, since he's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $100 million into the new stadium.</seg>
<seg id="4">As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One, opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium.</seg>
<seg id="5">A stadium craze is sweeping the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams.</seg>
<seg id="7">Something like one-third of the nation's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that.</seg>
<seg id="10">He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium.</seg>
<seg id="13">San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last month, Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $100 million stadium bond and tax proposition.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media -- and spent $100,000 on promotion.</seg>
<seg id="16">But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself, and rejected it 59% to 41%.</seg>
<seg id="17">In San Francisco, its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="18">George Christopher, the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s, won't endorse the new ballpark.</seg>
<seg id="19">He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal "games" of their own with the voters.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built.</seg>
<seg id="22">Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl, and instead built his own $100 million coliseum with private funds.</seg>
<seg id="24">He didn't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit. "This stadium shows that anything government can do, we can do better," Mr. Robbie says.</seg>
<seg id="25">But to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city's cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance. "The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith," he has said. "It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics."</seg>
<seg id="26">An Egyptian Pharaoh couldn't have justified his pyramids any better.</seg>
<seg id="27">But civilization has moved forward since then.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today taxpayers get to vote, most of the time, on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs, or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions.</seg>

<seg id="1">One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention.</seg>
<seg id="2">The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century.</seg>
<seg id="4">Today's Turks in Bulgaria, in other words, deserve what is coming to them four centuries later.</seg>
<seg id="5">As if this weren't enough, the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the "National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923," suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering, but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve.</seg>
<seg id="8">It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO.</seg>
<seg id="9">The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community.</seg>
<seg id="10">Turkey has been fighting its past for years, and thus far has been only partially successful.</seg>
<seg id="11">Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people?</seg>
<seg id="12">Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Dole's odd effort notwithstanding, most of Turkey's political problems lie with the Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="14">Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey isn't really part of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="15">Why, they wonder, should it belong to the EC?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: Turkey, we are told, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="18">No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument.</seg>
<seg id="19">Turkey in any event is long past it.</seg>
<seg id="20">The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kurds, suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria, Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis cannot be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently.</seg>
<seg id="24">Surely, the past suffering of any people at any time cannot be simply filed away and forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories.</seg>
<seg id="26">Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bulgaria's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months, and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past.</seg>

<seg id="2">Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.</seg>
<seg id="6">After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wayde.</seg>
<seg id="7">His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.</seg>
<seg id="9">The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.</seg>
<seg id="10">LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sims was 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.</seg>
<seg id="13">He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary</seg>
<seg id="2">Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.</seg>
<seg id="3">A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."</seg>
<seg id="6">Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.</seg>
<seg id="8">Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.</seg>
<seg id="11">The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.</seg>
<seg id="12">Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.</seg>
<seg id="14">I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's getting more and more tense," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Democratic-controlled House, by a margin of 51 votes, failed to override President Bush's veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest.</seg>
<seg id="2">The 231-191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces.</seg>
<seg id="3">It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush.</seg>
<seg id="4">Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin, but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president, who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yesterday's vote dealt with the largest of these bills, an estimated $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.</seg>
<seg id="6">To gain more leverage, abortion-rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the stark numbers yesterday -- when 282 votes were needed -- indicate the president is in a commanding position for at least this year. "Unless he changes, they lose," said a Democratic leadership aide.</seg>
<seg id="8">The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="9">By a lopsided 97-1 margin, the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and, despite reservations, the House adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll call.</seg>
<seg id="10">The package is more than $1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">But given the political importance of California, the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The $2.85 billion measure comes on top of $1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans.</seg>
<seg id="13">The bill last night includes $500 million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity.</seg>
<seg id="14">In direct cash assistance, $1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the Senate, Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months.</seg>
<seg id="16">The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week's earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="17">The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by Congress this fall and, since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law.</seg>
<seg id="18">The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and, apart from the health and education measure vetoed by Mr. Bush, bills funding the District of Columbia and the entire U.S. foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues.</seg>
<seg id="19">The vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years, and though the Democratic leadership is ambivalent about how to address the abortion issue, the debate is increasingly measured in party terms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote.</seg>
<seg id="21">By comparison, Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only 42 GOP members opposed the president's veto, a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year.</seg>
<seg id="23">At a recent White House meeting, Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.), the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto, and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday, they are plainly uncomfortable with his position.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This isn't a political issue, this is a moral issue," said Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement.</seg>
<seg id="25">But after years of using the issue for its benefit, the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent, GOP Rep. James Courter, who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent.</seg>
<seg id="27">In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers, Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.) lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the "chutzpah" to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion.</seg>
<seg id="28">Rep. Les AuCoin was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement. "This may not make George Bush a one-term president," said the Oregon liberal, addressing the Republican side of the House. "But if you support him over rape victims, this may be your last term."</seg>
<seg id="29">Separately, the House last night approved a nearly $67 billion compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration's ambitious space station in fiscal 1990 and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $124,875, and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="31">By a 325-92 margin, the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back an early challenge by House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) to the FHA provision.</seg>
<seg id="32">And on a closer 250-170 roll call, lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made by a House-Senate conference earmarking community development funds for more than 40 projects backed by often influential members.</seg>

<seg id="1">This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2">It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="3">The latter may seem oddly irrelevant, if not downright trivial, given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, however, Mr. Reagan's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those events continue to move at a rate, and in a direction, which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hungary is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic, the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.'s Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany's new maximum leader.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that is just for starters, or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of like, though lesser, note, Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost, and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev, in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so.</seg>
<seg id="11">And, last but not least, President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as "absolutely extraordinary" and believes that Mr. Krenz "can't turn the clock back" in East Germany because the change is too inexorable," as he told the New York Times's R.W. Apple Jr. (In other words, after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences, the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from Berlin to Siberia is a good thing to be welcomed, rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion.)</seg>
<seg id="12">All of this is what history will note, assuming that events don't make it seem a bad joke, when the record of this time is put down.</seg>
<seg id="13">For journalists, however, who write what they fondly view as history's first draft, this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder.</seg>
<seg id="14">It has been a well-paid transaction, this bartering away of the prestige of the republic's highest office.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $2 million, the Japanese government has put up just about as much, or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $7 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC's "Nightline." Punching away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target.</seg>
<seg id="17">As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election (and some would say thereafter as well).</seg>
<seg id="18">He was performing for pay, and why should anyone expect anything more?</seg>
<seg id="19">Primarily because there's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan's personal values, or lack of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards.</seg>
<seg id="21">The theme song for the 1980s has been, "Anything Goes," and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are those who say that this is nothing new, that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is evidence to support that view.</seg>
<seg id="24">Eighty-three years ago, William James wrote to H.G. Wells: "The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success . . . that, with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success, is our national disease."</seg>
<seg id="25">But if it was the national disease in 1906, it is today the national commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="26">If there is no law against it, do it.</seg>
<seg id="27">If the law leaves loopholes, use them.</seg>
<seg id="28">If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it, full speed ahead.</seg>
<seg id="29">And if you are caught or if people complain, simply argue that "everyone does it" or "no one said I shouldn't " and brazen it out.</seg>
<seg id="30">As a last recourse, when all else has failed and you are pinned, apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong. (See, for instance, Jim Bakker's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful.) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government "violated norms of behavior" in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra, and that apparently isn't going to change.</seg>
<seg id="33">For that matter, those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is the key to the current "national disease." No one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law.</seg>
<seg id="35">The occasional media witch hunt about some politician's private peccadilloes notwithstanding, the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain, "Who am I to judge?" Thus, no standards, no judgment and no values.</seg>
<seg id="36">"You are mad because he's making so much money," say President Reagan's defenders.</seg>
<seg id="37">No, we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him, enlisting it in the service of private gain, just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth, play disingenuous games about their activities or, to steal a phrase, make public service a private trough.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this, President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week's interview.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was referring to the "absolutely extraordinary" events in Eastern Europe, and it is a defensible position.</seg>
<seg id="40">But there is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="41">We didn't stampede into it, we slithered and slipped down the long slope, and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989: Everything for sale; nothing of real value.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy (on Arthur Avenue) and, of course, the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities" -- as a wrong turn into hell.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements" (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten Diana, age five).</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.</seg>
<seg id="6">She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings "glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.</seg>
<seg id="8">For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: ". . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures." Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really wasn't ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="10">She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie, whom she remembers as a loving liar, who realigned history to explain why Lily's father didn't live with them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rosie reinvented this man, who may or may not have known about his child, as a war hero for Lily's benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="13">The games Bronx children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure. "Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes.</seg>
<seg id="14">She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her friend Susan, whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all.</seg>
<seg id="17">Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rosie died, her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="19">They painted the apartment orange, pink and white, according to her instructions.</seg>
<seg id="20">With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist (who rhymed river with liver in a love song); and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission."</seg>
<seg id="21">They came by their strangeness honestly.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, "Philosophy for Women."</seg>
<seg id="23">The book loses some momentum toward the end, when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel, which flashes back to the New York of the '50s.</seg>
<seg id="26">But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95) feel cramped and static.</seg>
<seg id="27">For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns." Harry is now a 57-year-old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch.</seg>
<seg id="28">Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong. "An L.A. solution," explains Mr. Friedman.</seg>
<seg id="29">Line by line Mr. Friedman's weary cynicism can be amusing, especially when he's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up, immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it.</seg>
<seg id="30">Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife, who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it doesn't take too many lines to figure Harry out.</seg>
<seg id="32">He's a bore.</seg>

<seg id="1">In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.</seg>
<seg id="2">David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination.</seg>
<seg id="3">With due respect to "highly classified correspondence" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.</seg>
<seg id="4">If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought to know.</seg>
<seg id="5">What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping "top secret" on their own complicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">But there's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy, it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too.</seg>
<seg id="9">The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega.</seg>
<seg id="10">When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads.</seg>
<seg id="11">The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity.</seg>
<seg id="12">But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress?</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?</seg>
<seg id="14">What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops?</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you.</seg>
<seg id="17">Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: Confiding in the United States may be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="18">CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.</seg>
<seg id="19">The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point. "The interpretation" of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said, "and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me." In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter.</seg>
<seg id="21">And of course, doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties.</seg>
<seg id="22">Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra, deploring "Men of Zeal." No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.</seg>
<seg id="24">What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail?</seg>
<seg id="25">Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play?</seg>
<seg id="26">The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.</seg>
<seg id="29">The world being the nasty place it is, we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed.</seg>
<seg id="30">In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance, you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="31">The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.</seg>
<seg id="32">As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi.</seg>
<seg id="33">It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation?</seg>
<seg id="2">Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a "temporary" reduction when it is not?</seg>
<seg id="3">I think the reason is that you are confusing tax "rates" with tax "payments." Your Sept. 29 page-one story on the House-passed capital-gains plan is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="4">You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only.</seg>
<seg id="5">You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation, which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation: tax rate, times inflation rate, times basis for the gain.</seg>
<seg id="7">Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6% rate without indexation.</seg>
<seg id="8">But in any event -- and this is the important point -- tax "payments" on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law, even though the tax "rate" is the same under both systems.</seg>
<seg id="9">As you can see, the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary, but permanent.</seg>
<seg id="10">I hope that you begin talking about the plan's permanent and, in my view, most beneficial feature -- indexation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.)</seg>
<seg id="12">Washington</seg>
<seg id="13">That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6% is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses.</seg>
<seg id="15">But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991.</seg>
<seg id="16">To argue that this is "not likely" to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense.</seg>
<seg id="17">A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation, and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest?</seg>
<seg id="19">Under current law, it is not financially rational to forgo consumption.</seg>
<seg id="20">Real, aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1% or 2% a year.</seg>
<seg id="21">The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy, the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates, weak capital formation and high capital costs.</seg>

<seg id="1">At age eight, Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal.</seg>
<seg id="2">At age 19, she was a Paris sensation, transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is the stuff of dreams, but also of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, for Ms. Baker, the ride was far from over.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions, but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bricktop, another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris, said: "I don't think I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than Josephine's."</seg>
<seg id="8">Men were a constant complication.</seg>
<seg id="9">Baker had lots of them.</seg>
<seg id="10">But she didn't trust them and didn't reward trust.</seg>
<seg id="11">As she saw one key love affair, the problem wasn't her infidelity, it was his jealousy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Her appetite for children also was large.</seg>
<seg id="13">She adopted 12 of assorted races, naming them the Rainbow Tribe, and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="14">She made money, but spent more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Friends pitched in.</seg>
<seg id="16">Finally, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another lifelong complication, as Phyllis Rose makes clear in "Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time" (Doubleday, 321 pages, $22.50), was racism.</seg>
<seg id="18">Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris, where blacks had become exotic.</seg>
<seg id="19">African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks.</seg>
<seg id="20">To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized, but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences).</seg>
<seg id="22">Paris loved her at first sight. "She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her," sniffed the literary world's Maria Jolas, not entirely inaccurately. "One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end," Ms. Rose writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Rose, who teaches literature at Wesleyan University, quickly proceeds to overemphasize, claiming that Baker's dancing "had uncovered a new region for desire" and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Jazz Cleopatra" contains other, more important, false notes that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts Ms. Rose, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.</seg>
<seg id="27">Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.</seg>
<seg id="28">To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with Cleopatra, requires an equal stretch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris, two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show: a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life.</seg>
<seg id="30">In fact, Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca that could have made it into "Casablanca."</seg>
<seg id="31">During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted, a decision made by only about 2% of French citizens.</seg>
<seg id="32">She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle's cause, accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Humphrey Bogart's nightclub, Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in "La Marseillaise" to drown out the Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="34">The night the Germans occupied all of France, Baker performed in Casablanca.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Free French wore black arm bands, and when she sang "J'ai deux amours" they wept.</seg>
<seg id="36">Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II.</seg>
<seg id="37">In her introduction, Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker, but as "Jazz Cleopatra" goes on, it seems more rushed, as though the author were growing less interested.</seg>
<seg id="38">It doesn't help that sometimes Ms. Rose's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want.</seg>
<seg id="39">One chapter opens: "World War II was not one of France's glorious moments."</seg>
<seg id="40">Elsewhere, in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer, Ms. Rose writes: "She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman."</seg>
<seg id="41">One devoted fan who fell under Baker's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond.</seg>
<seg id="42">In "Josephine Baker" (Jonathan Cape, 304 pages, $35), which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month, Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star.</seg>
<seg id="43">The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read, but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker "The most sensational woman anybody ever saw.</seg>
<seg id="44">Or ever will."</seg>

<seg id="1">Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers</seg>
<seg id="2">Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory</seg>
<seg id="3">Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.</seg>
<seg id="8">Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors</seg>
<seg id="9">Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.</seg>
<seg id="10">Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.</seg>
<seg id="14">By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,</seg>
<seg id="15">That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.</seg>
<seg id="17">Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis</seg>
<seg id="19">BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena</seg>
<seg id="20">A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.</seg>
<seg id="21">To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="22">Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="23">He had so many heroes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rangers were short of inspiration, though.</seg>
<seg id="26">As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.</seg>

<seg id="1">The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist California's recovery from last week's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo.</seg>
<seg id="2">The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration, but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">By a 26-7 margin, the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative, and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) and his party's largest state delegation in the House.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no regrets about going forward," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D.,Calif.), who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting. "We are the Golden State," Mr. Fazio said, "and there is a certain amount of jealousy."</seg>
<seg id="5">The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for small-business loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.</seg>
<seg id="6">The funding is attached to a stopgap bill to keep most of the government operating through Nov. 15.</seg>
<seg id="7">The measure is expected to come before the House today, and Congress is under pressure to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow, when the current continuing resolution expires.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given California's size and political importance, the White House is eager to appear generous.</seg>
<seg id="9">But in private meetings yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman argued that only $1.5 billion in new federal appropriations are needed to supplement existing resources.</seg>
<seg id="10">A White House budget office analysis estimates that $500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California's needs, and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we've got to address it," said Mr. Darman, who came to the Capitol to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session. "I would hope very much that we wouldn't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat."</seg>
<seg id="12">Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans, no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten.</seg>
<seg id="13">A master of pork-barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $3.84 billion plan, Mr. Whitten insisted that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the delegation.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the chairman's motion, the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language, and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote, Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it.</seg>
<seg id="16">More important than money in many cases are waivers California is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds, such as a $100 million cap on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Whitten's package appears to accomplish this purpose, but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator, Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by California's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel.</seg>
<seg id="19">The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands, and lumber interests sought to add another $100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="20">California's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">One provision last night would have raised the cap on disaster loans to $500,000 from $100,000 per household to accommodate San Francisco losses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coordinated audit of the funds earmarked for the funding of projects implemented within the Operational Programme Cross-Border Cooperation the Czech Republic – Poland 2007–2013</seg>
<seg id="2">INTRODUCTION</seg>
<seg id="3">The developing union of people of Europe is the driving force behind the cross-border cooperation as a part of broader territorial cooperation that has been with us for more than 20 years by now.</seg>
<seg id="4">Let it provide itself the introduction into this joint report of supreme audit institutions of two close countries:</seg>
<seg id="5">“185 million EU citizens, or 37% of the population, live in border areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are often peripheral, underdeveloped or marginalised areas- sometimes the borders are historical scars.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main aim of cross-border cooperation is to reduce the effect of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, tackle common problems and exploit untapped potential.</seg>
<seg id="8">The programmes cover a variety of border regions: some work with maritime areas, others with internal EU land borders or borders shared with candidate countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Most programmes are bilateral, but some consist of more than two neighbouring countries (e.g. South Baltic programme).</seg>
<seg id="10">The programmes last for seven years. It should be noted that there is EUR 5.7 billion in total earmarked for all programmes in this period.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The programme activities include: Repairing and (re)building cross-border roads, cycle paths or bridges; Investing in cross-border waste systems, medical equipment, research centres, anti-flood measures, and so on; Managing jointly natural or tourism sites; Developing common services for the local population; Advising on employment issues; and Creating thematic networks and clusters for innovation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The funding is granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border, such as regional authorities, universities and small and medium enterprises, come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Representatives of cooperating regions, thematic ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects are going to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="14">This unique structure is supposed to lead to sustainable collaboration that continues long after the programme ends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The funding is granted on condition that partners from both sides of the border work together and fulfil at least two of the following conditions: common financing, common staffing, common preparation and common implementation of the project.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Within the partnership framework, the tasks and responsibility for preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed among the respective partners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The following are main attributes: joint selection of leading partner; joint preparation of project and applications; making of joint agreement of partnership signed by all partners; overtaking of complete responsibility for project implementation by leading partner; total support payments received by leading partner who completes their transfer to respective project partners.</seg>
<seg id="18">The support can be granted to eligible projects implemented in the regions and voivodeships adjacent to the joint border.</seg>
<seg id="19">AUDIT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE</seg>
<seg id="20">On 11 December 2007 the European Commission approved the Operational Programme Cross-Border Cooperation the Czech Republic – Poland 2007–2013 (OP CBC CZ-PL).</seg>
<seg id="21">EUR 258 187 467 was allocated for the implementation of the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">This amount included the contribution of EU funds (ERDF funds) in the total amount of EUR 219 459 344 (85%) which must be settled by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="23">Financial data related to the drawdown of EU resources from the Programme as of the end of the year 2013 are presented in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="24">The Agreement of Cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office (NKU) and the Supreme Audit Office of Poland (NIK) was signed on 27 February 2013 after previous deliberations at the meeting of the heads of the supreme audit institutions of Visegrád countries, Austria and Slovenia in Lovasberény in Hungary in September 2012.</seg>
<seg id="25">The objective of the cooperation was to verify whether the OP CBC CZ-PL is being implemented in accordance with legal regulations and with obligatory programme documents or agreements, the management and control system is reliable, the objectives of the Operational Programme are reached, and selected projects are implemented in accordance with the obligatory criteria set in the grant agreements or decisions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The cooperation took the form of a parallel audit during which the supreme audit institutions, in compliance with their mandate, verified independently the topics which were previously discussed by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="27">It had a character of compliance audit focusing on the implementation of OP CBC CZ-PL.</seg>
<seg id="28">The completed audit had also elements of performance audit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The selected topics were verified on the sample of projects at the project partners on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="30">The results of the executed audits were audit reports published independently by both institutions in regular manner.</seg>
<seg id="31">This joint report was prepared on the basis of these audit reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">The selected joint audit sample included six projects (see attachment 1) which fall under the intervention area 1.1 – Strengthening of transport accessibility and intervention area 2.2 – Tourism development support.</seg>
<seg id="33">Prior to the beginning of the audit, the drawdown of the financial resources from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of financial resources paid out to beneficiaries until the end of the year 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the OP CBC CZ-PL.</seg>
<seg id="34">In total, amounts of EUR 39 748 636 and EUR 42 714 548 were paid out in the intervention areas 1.1 and 2.2, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="35">Apart from the audit of a common sample of six projects, the NKU conducted audits of 13 other projects and NIK audits of two additional projects (all of them in areas 1.1 and 2.2).</seg>
<seg id="36">The financial means paid to beneficiaries from the ERDF that were audited by NKU and NIK amounted to EUR 25 362 174 and EUR 8 450 784, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="37">The audited amount represented 41% of the financial means paid to the beneficiaries in the intervention areas 1.1 and 2.2.</seg>
<seg id="38">THE MAIN AUDIT CONCLUSION</seg>
<seg id="39">Both audits carried out by the NKU on the Czech side and by the NIK on the Polish side of the border have shown that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the materiality threshold.</seg>
<seg id="40">The implementation of the OP CBC CZ-PL, including the management and control system performance and the realization of selected projects, was successful.</seg>
<seg id="41">Actions taken by the audited entities established within the management and control system, limited the risk of improper expenditure of funds, as well as the possibility of failure to utilise the available ERDF funds.</seg>
<seg id="42">What indicates the effectiveness of the operations carried out within the Operational Programme is a high level of achievement of the results, which was also confirmed by the social evaluation of projects´ completion.</seg>
<seg id="43">SUMMARY OF THE AUDIT RESULTS</seg>
<seg id="44">A. Assessment of the management and control system</seg>
<seg id="45">The coordinated approach allowed carrying out an audit of the management and control system of OP CBC CZ-PL implemented by institutions of both countries: Managing Authority (Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic), National Coordinator (Ministry of Regional Development of Poland), Comptrollers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodes).</seg>
<seg id="46">The audit also allowed for evaluation of tasks and functions performed by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">During the assessment of the management system, the focus was on the set-up and performance of the Managing Authority and National Coordinator functions, particularly on the programme objectives set-up and monitoring of the progress, evaluation and annual reports, assessment, review, selection and authorisation of project applications, Operational Programme resources drawdown, publishing of correct, complete and up-to-date information about grants, on the control activity of the Managing Authority, set-up and performance of commissioned audit entity, on the management and reporting of irregularities and coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions taking part in the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="48">Furthermore, the activity of the respective authorities was audited in the area of risk analysis and the control plan design related to the on-the-spot checks. The evaluations of project applications carried out by independent experts were also scrutinised.</seg>
<seg id="49">The audit of the control system included verification of on-the-spot and administrative checks which enabled confirmation of e.g. the products delivery and co-financed services, eligibility of the expenditure declared for reimbursement, as well as the compliance of such expenditure and related operations (or their parts) with EU and national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="50">The NKU found significant shortcomings in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information about provided grants.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the area of projects assessment and authorisation, the risk to the transparency of the process was identified.</seg>
<seg id="52">Further shortcomings were found in the area of monitoring indicators set-up and in the set-up of system for reporting irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="53">Based on the findings, the NKU evaluated the management and control system implemented by the Managing Authority as partially effective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The irregularities, identified by the NIK, related to management and control system functioning in Poland concerning both violation of existing law and the lack of regularity in the undertaken activities were not evaluated by the NIK as material.</seg>
<seg id="55">The results of these irregularities concerned individual projects and did not crucially influence the implementation of the OP CBC CZ-PL.</seg>
<seg id="56">Despite the identified irregularities, the NIK evaluated the system functioning positively.</seg>
<seg id="57">B. Evaluation of project effects</seg>
<seg id="58">The audit has shown no inconsistency between the indicators and objectives set for each project and those included in the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="59">In all the audited projects the expected results were achieved, the activities supported by funding have actually been executed; indicators (measurable parameters) set in the project applications for the Operational Programme funding have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="60">These audit conclusions are in agreement with the results of the public opinion poll, the realization of which is described further in this chapter.</seg>
<seg id="61">The important aspect, which both the NKU and NIK paid attention to in their audit reports, is the reduced possibility of objective verification of the achievement of assumed effects of individual projects, both when it comes to the objectives of individual projects, as well as of the whole Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NIK initiated a public opinion poll which took place in the summer of 2013 in the location of the projects implementation.</seg>
<seg id="63">The poll and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).</seg>
<seg id="64">After the agreement with the NKU, a survey was carried out on both sides of the border on a sample of 2 820 people, i.e. both among the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and among the public in the Czech Republic in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="65">The survey particularly concerned the validity, quality, interaction, resource utilization and social functionality of projects, including the investments.</seg>
<seg id="66">The number of respondents at the individual projects is presented in the attachment 2.</seg>
<seg id="67">The analysis of the poll responses indicates that the total social evaluation of final projects was good and averaged 4.8 (on a scale up to 8 pts.), which means that their impact has been positively assessed by the majority of respondents, both according to the objectives as well as other parameters declared in applications.</seg>
<seg id="68">According to the respondents the surveyed projects met the criteria formulated within the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="69">Respondents have noticed the positive impact of investment on improvement of the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, touristic attractiveness, the entrepreneurial conditions, quality of life of inhabitants, the resumption of contacts between the inhabitants of the border region.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the other hand, the overall evaluation of responses indicates the difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (the actual level of impact), and the level expected by respondents.</seg>
<seg id="71">This also applies to the assessment of the individual effects; in some cases the difference is significant.</seg>
<seg id="72">The results of the survey were consistent with the opinions of the participants of panel discussions (focus groups), carried out within the NIK audit on the Polish side, who pointed to the need of the implementation of projects and confirmed their positive public perception and the achievement of the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="73">C. Assessment of legality of audited projects</seg>
<seg id="74">At the beneficiary level, the audit focused particularly on material and timely implementation of a project and the compliance with the schedule and contents of the project application, fulfilment of project pre-set goals and objectives and mandatory monitoring indicators, management of project amendments, handling of potential project revenues, identification of project transactions, prohibition of cross-financing from various EU resources, implementation of the project partnership and fulfilment of its conditions, required publicity related mainly to advertising the role of EU financial resources, eligibility of project expenditure and public procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="75">The total financial amount of ascertained shortcomings qualified by NIK and NKU as expenditure ineligible for the support from EU funds was EUR 85 094.</seg>
<seg id="76">The amount however did not exceed the materiality threshold set in relation to the total volume of audited financial resources in the sample of projects.</seg>
<seg id="77">Despite the identified irregularities, the NIK and the NKU evaluated positively actions taken by the beneficiaries for the implementation of selected projects.</seg>
<seg id="78">In the vast majority of cases, the obligations arising from contracts for financing were properly implemented by the beneficiaries.</seg>
<seg id="79">The funds for the implementation of the audited projects were expended in accordance with the provisions of the EU and national law.</seg>
<seg id="80">However, in seven out of eight audited beneficiaries audited by the NIK, the irregularities were found in the implementation of material and financial responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="81">These were individual cases of non-system nature and concerned in particular the unreliable preparation of tender documentation and infringement of the regulations of public procurement, but without effect on the selection of contractor or delivery of contracted works.</seg>
<seg id="82">Only in one of all the projects audited by NIK, irregularity, which concerned non-compliance with reporting obligations, may result in the assessing the expenditure in the amount of PLN 43 003 as ineligible (of which EUR 8 231 were financed from ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="83">On the other side of the border, the NKU identified in three out of 19 audited projects ineligible expenditure in the amount of CZK 2 098 053 (out of which EUR 76 863 were financed from ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="84">The irregularities included non-delivery of financed material and works and expenditure for upgrading a property in the ownership of a party unrelated to the project (either as a project beneficiary or a partner).</seg>
<seg id="85">RECOMMENDATIONS</seg>
<seg id="86">A common recommendation of the NKU and the NIK concerns an improvement of the monitoring system specifically by consistent assignation of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of priority axis of the Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="87">Generally, it is also necessary to aim for designing monitoring indicators both on the programme and project level which would enable more operative verification of the achievement of set effects.</seg>
<seg id="88">Remarks and recommendations resulting from the audits carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit reports of NKU and NIK on CD.</seg>
<seg id="89">COMMUNIQUÉ</seg>
<seg id="90">The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the Presidents of supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and Poland.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio?</seg>
<seg id="2">First, a pop quiz.</seg>
<seg id="3">When you think of the words "risk" and "investment," what's the specific peril that comes to mind?</seg>
<seg id="4">Pencils down.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you're like most people, you said it's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="6">"People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension," says Timothy Kochis, national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte, Haskins & Sells.</seg>
<seg id="7">But therein lies another aspect of investment risk: the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night, lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Risk wears many disguises, and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other, less obvious kinds.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Treasury bonds, for example, are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity.</seg>
<seg id="11">But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed-dollar interest payments.</seg>
<seg id="12">Risk is also a function of time.</seg>
<seg id="13">When financial professionals measure risk mathematically, they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills, for example, because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is usually measured by the standard deviation, or divergence, of annual results from the average return over time.</seg>
<seg id="16">But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">For instance, some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash; last Friday's debacle only reinforced those feelings.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the stock market, despite some stomach-churning declines, has far outperformed other securities over extended periods.</seg>
<seg id="19">By retreating to the apparent security of, say, money-market funds, investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives," says Steven B. Enright, a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients' portfolios.</seg>
<seg id="22">They estimate the return a person's current portfolio is likely to generate over time, along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year.</seg>
<seg id="23">They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals.</seg>
<seg id="24">And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified.</seg>
<seg id="25">The portfolios of two hypothetical families, one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45, illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider.</seg>
<seg id="26">For instance, the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk.</seg>
<seg id="27">But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk.</seg>
<seg id="28">The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue.</seg>
<seg id="29">Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by Seidman Financial Services, which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman.</seg>
<seg id="30">That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings.</seg>
<seg id="31">But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility, as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple's portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="32">(Here's how to interpret a standard deviation figure: Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation.</seg>
<seg id="34">In two of three years, the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range.</seg>
<seg id="36">There's a 95% probability any year's result will fall in the range.)</seg>
<seg id="37">Of course, the greater volatility of the younger couple's portfolio doesn't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders' long-term goals.</seg>
<seg id="38">Indeed, the older couple's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return won't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans.</seg>
<seg id="39">"They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market," says John H. Cammack, a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington. "But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future."</seg>
<seg id="40">Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.</seg>
<seg id="41">When it comes to investing, trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded: Investors don't know the actual returns that securities will deliver, or the ups and downs that will occur along the way.</seg>
<seg id="42">Looking to the past can provide some clues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Over several decades, for instance, investors who put up with the stock market's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and "cash" investments like Treasury bills.</seg>
<seg id="44">But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">For instance, some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="46">And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past.</seg>
<seg id="47">Portfolio A: Retired couple, age 65; $400,000 portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="48">Portfolio B: Two-income couple, age 45; $150,000 portfolio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant, ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads.</seg>
<seg id="2">The killers fled with less than $100.</seg>
<seg id="3">Describing this and other grisly killings, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty. "The ultimate punishment," he declared, "will protect the law-abiding from the vicious, cruel individuals who commit these crimes."</seg>
<seg id="4">There's just one problem: The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most murders are state crimes, so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Senate Republicans, after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation, have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pending bill, introduced by Mr. Thurmond, would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 1972, the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in 1976, the court permitted resurrection of such laws, if they meet certain procedural requirements.</seg>
<seg id="13">For instance, juries would have to consider specific "aggravating" and "mitigating" factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since that 1976 ruling, 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="15">But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level, with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes, most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among these crimes are murder on federal land, presidential assassination and espionage.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death, including murder for hire. (Separately, the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill Americans abroad.)</seg>
<seg id="19">Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue, one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty, on top of existing state laws, would deter any would-be criminals.</seg>
<seg id="20">For one thing, it's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences, let alone be executed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice, for instance, or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years, according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff.</seg>
<seg id="23">The last federal execution before the Supreme Court's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963, meaning that the federal government didn't exercise its execution authority for eight years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"In that sense, the whole debate is sort of a fraud," argues a Democratic Senate staff member. "It's distracting attention from serious issues, like how to make DEA, FBI and Customs work together" on drug enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="25">Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill, but they contend that isn't the point. "Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes," says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).</seg>
<seg id="26">Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur, are also "proper retribution" for heinous crimes, Mr. Hatch argues.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thomas Boyd, a senior Justice Department official, says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals, this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate.</seg>
<seg id="29">Before the bill left committee, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner.</seg>
<seg id="30">The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond, who complained that it would "kill" capital punishment.</seg>
<seg id="31">A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion.</seg>
<seg id="32">And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings, in two important ways.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past.</seg>
<seg id="34">And it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities.</seg>
<seg id="35">"That burden is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet," says Mr. Boyd. "How do you prove a negative?" Since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing, executions everywhere might come to a halt, Mr. Boyd explains.</seg>
<seg id="36">At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks, and against black defendants compared with white defendants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research, regardless of its accuracy, isn't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Kennedy amendment would, in effect, legislate around the Supreme Court ruling.</seg>
<seg id="39">Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals, says Richard Burr, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's capital-punishment defense team.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mr. Kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year's anti-drug legislation, and it will be severely attacked on the Senate floor this time around.</seg>
<seg id="41">But if it survives, it could prompt other statutory changes, according to the Mr. Burr.</seg>
<seg id="42">It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="43">Narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has.</seg>
<seg id="44">And that, in turn, would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="2">There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies.</seg>
<seg id="4">They've fallen out over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The croaker's done gone from the hook -- damn! My language sure goes to pot down here on the coast." The husky blond guide with the Aggie cap twists his face in mock fury. "I got to get back to school and straighten out my English."</seg>
<seg id="2">He has two more years at Texas A&M.</seg>
<seg id="3">Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas, enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond.</seg>
<seg id="4">There have been three days of hot, wind-swept rain, and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout, which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="5">The little radio fizzes as other boats want to see if we have found any fish -- spotting location is everything in this sport.</seg>
<seg id="6">Negative answers crackle back.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships.</seg>
<seg id="8">We go from one to the other.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sun is hot now though it's only 8 in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water.</seg>
<seg id="11">We cruise toward another set of pilings.</seg>
<seg id="12">The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then he casts out. "Just wait for that tap-tap, that thump-thump.</seg>

<seg id="15">Don't forget, trout have very soft mouths."</seg>
<seg id="16">The radio queries again. "Pickin' one or two," says the guide, chuckling. "You can tell they've got nothin'." A pair of black skimmers zig-zag past close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soon we have our limit of the shimmering fish stippled in rose-gold and black.</seg>
<seg id="18">And we are the first back at the dock, where the great blue herons stand waiting by the cleaning benches.</seg>
<seg id="19">The guide is young and he knows this business but he wants a different life after college, such as working for IBM and wearing a necktie.</seg>
<seg id="20">This must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that is "undeveloped." There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby.</seg>
<seg id="21">People are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Texas is big and beautiful and they live here, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula (after the oak, not the game) which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge.</seg>

<seg id="25">Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake thinking that it was a snow goose.</seg>
<seg id="26">He paid an immense fine and was lucky, according to a local wag, to escape the gas chamber.</seg>
<seg id="27">The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see.</seg>
<seg id="28">Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies.</seg>

<seg id="1">With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama, one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this: Is the National Security Council staff big enough, and does it have enough clout, to do its job of coordinating foreign policy?</seg>
<seg id="2">President Bush's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission, which investigated the Iran-Contra affair.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan's second term.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, following both the style he pursued as President Ford's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission, Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely, gathering the views of the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be "small" and warned against letting "energetic self-starters" like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department, Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big, diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">During the coup attempt and its aftermath, NSC staffers were "stretched very thin," says one senior administration official. "It's a very small shop."</seg>
<seg id="9">Gen. Scowcroft doesn't plan to increase the staff right now, but is weighing that possibility, the official adds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The NSC staff "doesn't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process," says Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy, a conservative Washington think-tank. "The problem with this administration, I think, is that by design it has greatly diminished, both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense, the role of the NSC."</seg>
<seg id="11">The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need, in an increasingly complex world, for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies.</seg>
<seg id="12">By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense.</seg>
<seg id="13">In practice, the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the size, shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide.</seg>
<seg id="15">That task is one of Washington's perennial problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Bush White House, the size of the NSC's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials say.</seg>
<seg id="17">Administration officials insist that the size of the staff wasn't a problem during the Panama crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America, Everett Briggs, was gone.</seg>
<seg id="19">He had just resigned, at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua's Contra rebels.</seg>
<seg id="20">The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert Gates, are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control, and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both have become confidants of President Bush.</seg>
<seg id="24">But neither has an extensive background in Latin America, the Middle East or Asia.</seg>
<seg id="25">In those areas, the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus.</seg>
<seg id="27">But just as every previous NSC adviser has, Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained.</seg>

<seg id="1">Among the things I learned covering the World Series these past few weeks is that the Richter scale, which measures earthquakes, isn't like the one in your bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="2">A quake that measures two on the Richter isn't twice as severe as a "one" -- it's 10 times worse.</seg>
<seg id="3">A "three" is 10 times 10 again, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="4">That put the "seven" of Oct. 17 in perspective for me.</seg>
<seg id="5">Think I'll buy one of those "I Survived" T-shirts after all.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Richterian standards, the show that the Oakland Athletics put on Friday and Saturday nights, in putting a mercifully swift end to the game's Longest Short Series, rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boys with the white elephants on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much, but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Pale Pachyderms propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the San Francisco Giants.</seg>
<seg id="9">Combined with their two pre-quake victories, way back on Oct. 14 and 15 (the scores were 5-0 and 5-1, remember?), that gave them a sweep of the best-of-seven series.</seg>
<seg id="10">The joke here is that the Giants lost by de fault.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's geologically correct, but a trifle unfair otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="12">They showed up, but didn't -- or couldn't -- challenge.</seg>
<seg id="13">They led for nary an inning in the four games, and managed to stir their fans only once.</seg>
<seg id="14">That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, trailing 8-2, they scored four times and brought their big heat -- Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell -- to the plate with one out and a runner on.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Clark flied out to short right field and Mitchell's drive to left was caught on the warning track by Rickey Henderson as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I went out to Todd {Burns, the A's reliever} and told him that we weren't gonna let this guy beat us," said Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach of the decisive confrontation with Mitchell, the National League's reigning home-run king. "I told him to make Mitchell reach for everything, and that's what we did.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ball he hit wasn't a strike.</seg>
<seg id="18">If it had been, he mighta hit it out."</seg>
<seg id="19">But if the A's hadn't won in four, they would have prevailed in five, or six, or seven.</seg>
<seg id="20">The best team won this Series, which is more unusual than it may sound.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baseball ain't football, where the good teams beat up on the bad ones.</seg>
<seg id="22">The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10.</seg>
<seg id="23">Without becoming overly contentious, allow me to suggest that several recent champions of the world according to us (as in U.S.) might not have ranked No. 1 in many polls.</seg>
<seg id="24">That list includes last season's champs, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who rode a miracle home run by Kirk Gibson and two faultless pitching performances by Orel Hershiser to a five-game triumph over a bewitched, bothered Oakland crew.</seg>
<seg id="25">These A's, however, got few grades as low as B on their 1989 report card.</seg>
<seg id="26">They led the Major Leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record.</seg>
<seg id="28">Asked what he would do differently on the morrow, Craig allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper, "maybe on the other side of the fence."</seg>
<seg id="29">The A's offensive showing in the Series got an A, as in awesome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four-game set, and their nine home runs tied one.</seg>
<seg id="31">Eight Oakland players hit homers, with centerfielder Dave Henderson getting two, both on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rickey Henderson, the do-everything leadoff man, had nine hits and set or tied four-game Series marks for triples (2) and stolen bases (3).</seg>
<seg id="33">The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire, their regular-season leader with 33, and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt. "Think I'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove," quipped the big first baseman Saturday night, fingering the gold bat he wears on a neck chain.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even with that power show, though, the Oakland Series' star, certified by the Most Valuable Player award, was a pitcher, Dave Stewart.</seg>
<seg id="35">He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One, and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="36">Stewart's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds.</seg>
<seg id="37">One was that, despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News, he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due.</seg>
<seg id="38">The other is that he's an Oakland native, and lifted residents' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas last week.</seg>
<seg id="39">Afterward, as the A's toasted their victory with beer (they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims), Stewart said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy. "Give me four or five more Series with these guys, and I don't care if I ever win a Cy Young," he said, in reference to baseball's best-pitcher award.</seg>
<seg id="40">Indeed, the possibility of an A's ring cycle, a/k/a a dynasty, was a major topic of post-game discussion Saturday, so much so that Sandy Alderson, the team's general manager, felt obliged to dampen it. "People change, teams change," he cautioned. "It's easier to get worse than better in this game."</seg>
<seg id="41">He might have added an interesting historical fact: The last Series sweep, by the Cincinnati Reds, came in 1976, which also was the first year of baseball player free agency.</seg>
<seg id="42">It was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous, "big market" teams to monopolize the best talent, but quite the opposite has occurred: Twelve different clubs have won titles in the 14 seasons since its advent.</seg>
<seg id="43">The number includes such unstylish burgs as, well, Oakland.</seg>

<seg id="1">The House joined the Senate in making federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the Treasury Department to meet expedited payments of an estimated $1.25 billion during the next several years.</seg>
<seg id="2">The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $17.2 billion to the departments of State, Justice, and Commerce in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">An estimated $40 million would come annually from a new $20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the Justice Department, and Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees would rise by 25% to fund a $26 million increase in the agency's budget.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday's vote on Japanese-American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision, which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988. "The only way to reduce the costs is to say we don't want to pay the bill," said Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa), who taunted President Bush's party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $20,000 per individual. "Read my lips," said Mr. Smith. "If you're for paying the claims . . . I don't know how anyone can oppose this."</seg>
<seg id="5">No payments would be made this year, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of $1.25 billion is met.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority.</seg>
<seg id="7">As much as Republicans led the opposition, among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement, 42 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders.</seg>
<seg id="8">The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The measure provides $321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration.</seg>
<seg id="10">The conservative bent of the incumbent appointees, named by former President Reagan, has divided Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="11">And on back-to-back roll calls, 206-199 and 223-178, the Appropriations Committee leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.)</seg>
<seg id="12">The estimated $40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided between the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, which both face serious cuts if the income isn't realized.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Federal Bureau of Investigation is slated to receive $30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil cases, and the judiciary will rely on another $32 million from bankruptcy charges, including a 33% increase in the current filing fee.</seg>
<seg id="14">The $17.2 billion total for the bill doesn't include an estimated $1.2 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds approved by the House-Senate conference yesterday, and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The House agreed to defer for a year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants but, by a 287-123 margin, the chamber stripped a Senate initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states, such as New Hampshire and Delaware, to $1.6 million from $500,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves -- including the three authors of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law.</seg>
<seg id="17">When a House-Senate conference on yesterday's bill rescinded $11.8 million in unexpended funds for a Fort Worth, Texas, economic development project backed by former Speaker James Wright, Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) insisted last week that the money be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure includes $2 million secured by Mr. Rudman for a marine-research project at the University of New Hampshire, and Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) used his power to add $10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">This was in addition to a more parochial $4.5 million authorization for a health center in South Carolina upheld by a 273-121 vote in the House last night.</seg>

<seg id="1">After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system, Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter: big business.</seg>
<seg id="2">Corporate leaders, frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs, are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="3">Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could "lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance," Arthur Puccini, a General Electric Co. vice president, warned earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs, improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program, and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system.</seg>
<seg id="7">But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine. "I can't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is," says Mr. Seidman, who heads the AFL-CIO's department dealing with health matters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the Bush administration isn't taking the initiative on health issues, business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who champion health-care revision. "Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue," says Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.). "It's a bottom-line issue." Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost-control measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Partly in response, a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices.</seg>
<seg id="11">At 11.1% of gross national product, U.S. health costs already are the highest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">By contrast, Japan's equal 6.7% of GNP, a nation's total output of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="13">Management and labor worry that the gap makes U.S. companies less competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chrysler Corp. estimates that health costs add $700 to the price of each of its cars, about $300 to $500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health. "The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength," complains Walter Maher, a Chrysler health-and-benefits specialist.</seg>
<seg id="15">Labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against Pittston Co. and Nynex Corp.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their new contract this year, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed to look for "prompt and lasting national solutions" to rising health-care costs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="19">Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, scoffs at "capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system" for health. "They hope they can buy some government cost discipline," but this is a false hope, Mr. Schramm says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far neither the Bush administration nor Congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care.</seg>
<seg id="22">The administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988, which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage.</seg>
<seg id="24">A bipartisan commission established by Congress and headed by Sen. John Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next March 1.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quadrennial commission appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is expected to report next summer.</seg>
<seg id="27">"No magic bullet will be discovered next year, an election year," says Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) But 1991 could be a window for action.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pressure for change will rise with costs. "I think employers are really going to be the ones to push for major change," says Sharon Canner, a health expert at NAM.</seg>
<seg id="29">Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups, particularly the American Medical Association, and perhaps from the public as well, if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care.</seg>
<seg id="30">The NAM embraces efforts, which both the administration and the medical profession have begun, to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="31">Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="32">HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25% of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="33">Limiting care won't be easy or popular. "To slow the rise in total spending, it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services," the NAM warns in a policy statement.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will "require us to define -- and redefine -- what is `necessary' or `appropriate' care.</seg>
<seg id="35">This involves trade-offs and {it} cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is `necessary. '"</seg>
<seg id="36">The AFL-CIO also embraces treatment guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="37">In addition, it's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way to slow health-care spending.</seg>
<seg id="38">At a meeting here on Nov. 15, the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which is the most troublesome right now?</seg>
<seg id="2">A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="3">Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT).</seg>
<seg id="4">Not only is Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup," he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup," and he's currently a man in hot water.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here, in neutral language, is the gist of Mr. Mason's remarks, quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign, and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said Jews were "sick with complexes"; and he called David Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani's black opponent, "a fancy shvartze with a mustache."</seg>
<seg id="12">If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot?</seg>
<seg id="13">It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="16">People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck."</seg>
<seg id="17">These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group, such as "Polish jokes"; and the type that is double-edged, aiming inward as well as outward.</seg>
<seg id="18">The latter typically is the humor of the underdog, and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.</seg>
<seg id="20">But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.</seg>
<seg id="21">Why constructive?</seg>
<seg id="22">Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why it's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police, on college campuses and elsewhere, taboo all critical mention of group differences.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook, "Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer." The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam?</seg>
<seg id="25">Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines.</seg>
<seg id="27">In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (Lynn Redgrave), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (Rita Karin) and her brother Michael (Brandon Maggart).</seg>
<seg id="28">It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="29">At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie.</seg>
<seg id="30">It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup" is being made from an old recipe.</seg>
<seg id="31">And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="32">Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of "Abie's Irish Rose" made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author, Anne Nichols, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="33">And it has remained there, as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called "Bridget Loves Bernie," whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney.</seg>
<seg id="34">Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all.</seg>
<seg id="35">So far, the bubbles have been few and far between.</seg>
<seg id="36">Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms, ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear, to preach about social issues.</seg>
<seg id="37">To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them.</seg>
<seg id="38">For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona.</seg>
<seg id="40">The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself.</seg>
<seg id="41">But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade-ethnic differences.</seg>
<seg id="42">I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.</seg>
<seg id="43">That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer.</seg>
<seg id="44">But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.</seg>
<seg id="45">At your age, Jackie, you ought to know that you can't make soup without turning up the flame.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six prison officers have been injured in a disturbance at a high security men's jail, the Prison Office has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight inmates and is contained to one wing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.</seg>
<seg id="8">We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."</seg>
<seg id="9">HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">In June it was reported that the prison's governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="11">And in October last year riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.</seg>

<seg id="1">There are two versions of "Measure for Measure" on stage at the Alley Theater here.</seg>
<seg id="2">One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of Shakespeare's play; the other is director Gregory Boyd's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Measure for Measure" is one of Shakespeare's "problem" plays, so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy, comedy or history.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last season, Hartford Stage director Mark Lamos mounted a production at Lincoln Center, and currently two other productions -- one just closed at the Old Globe in San Diego and another now at the Seattle Rep -- overlap with Mr. Boyd's.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the play, the Duke of Vienna despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical Angelo, hoping he can set things right.</seg>
<seg id="7">When Angelo hears that the young man Claudio has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her, Angelo summarily condemns Claudio to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">When, however, Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novitiate in a convent, goes to Angelo to plead her brother's case, the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and, in a supreme act of hypocrisy, demands that Isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother's life.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the Duke, who set the original scheme in motion, appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the Duke arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the Alley production, scene designer Peter David Gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the action requires, a prison cell, consisting of an enlarged wire cage, rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the play's major scenes Mr. Boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="13">When Isabella (Ellen Lauren) confronts her brother Claudio (Matt Loney) in his cell, explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom; when Isabella and the disguised Duke (Philip Kerr) conspire to trick Angelo; and when Mariana (Annalee Jefferies), a woman wronged by Angelo, confronts him with his past misdeeds, the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At such moments Mr. Boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="15">When, however, he decides to be modern, or more accurately, when he decides to be trendy, the results are far less satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today's audiences.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's a valid approach, but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his "Measure," Mr. Boyd has "modernized" the pimps and prostitutes of Vienna whom Angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites, punk rockers and heavy metal types, with a strong emphasis on leather, chains and porno-inspired costumes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes, even those in the convent.</seg>
<seg id="20">When Claudio is arrested, he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the opportunist Lucio (Jack Stehlin) visits the convent to inform Isabella of her brother's fate, Lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear, but brings along a voluptuous companion (Jill Powell), not in Shakespeare's script, to undulate lasciviously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the pimp Pompey (Glen Allen Pruett), dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece, indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe.</seg>
<seg id="23">The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="24">The inclusion at one point, for example, of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors, ranging from Jim Bakker and Leona Helmsley to Zsa Zsa Gabor, is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. Boyd's ability.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite the excesses, however, the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's more, it represents an important step for the Alley Theater. "Measure for Measure" is Mr. Boyd's first directorial assignment as the theater's new artistic director.</seg>
<seg id="27">He succeeded Pat Brown, who was fired by the Alley board 18 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler, head of Theatre Communications Group, to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board.</seg>
<seg id="29">None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. Brown's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the Alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts.</seg>
<seg id="31">Not only is Mr. Boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage, the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">As opposed to the $1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season, the 1988-89 year concluded with a $200,000 surplus and a $500,000 cash reserve.</seg>
<seg id="33">Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," helped a lot, but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, Nina Vance, was at the height of her powers.</seg>
<seg id="35">But it is clear he is going to give it a shot.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!</seg>
<seg id="6">Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="12">First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.</seg>
<seg id="14">The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.</seg>
<seg id="20">These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do: revive a constituency for the Contra rebels.</seg>
<seg id="2">Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that "if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees."</seg>
<seg id="3">But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that Mr. Ortega's threat was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it."</seg>
<seg id="5">The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America's progress toward democracy in the region, attended by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army.</seg>
<seg id="8">Saturday, he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras.</seg>
<seg id="9">He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels.</seg>
<seg id="10">Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.</seg>
<seg id="12">And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March.</seg>
<seg id="13">The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="15">Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said yesterday on "Meet the Press": "I would hope after his {Mr.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid." Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader.</seg>
<seg id="17">While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The administration should now state that if the {February} election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid," said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. "In these circumstances, I think they'd win."</seg>
<seg id="19">Sen. Mitchell said that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections, although he added that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Ortega's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Secretary of State James Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: "I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Baker's assistant for inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson, while maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: "It's never very clear who starts what." He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections.</seg>
<seg id="24">Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega's wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="26">"My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning" by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The U.S., which is finalizing its steel-import quotas, is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.</seg>
<seg id="2">Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota, and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which isn't included in the quota program.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas, known as voluntary restraint agreements, until March 31, 1992.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments.</seg>
<seg id="11">The U.S. termed its plan, a "trade liberalization program," despite the fact that it is merely an extension.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mexico, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.</seg>
<seg id="13">South Korea, which had 1.9% under the previous quotas, is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%.</seg>
<seg id="14">That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share it has had in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EC and Japan -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.</seg>
<seg id="17">The EC steel industry, which has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.</seg>
<seg id="18">Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="20">But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984.</seg>
<seg id="21">Japan, however, has agreed to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program.</seg>
<seg id="23">The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.</seg>
<seg id="24">The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.</seg>
<seg id="25">That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance.</seg>
<seg id="26">Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate.</seg>
<seg id="27">These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Where do Americans put their money?</seg>
<seg id="2">It depends on when you look.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 1900, for instance, less than 8% of assets went into bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="4">That rose to nearly 18% during the Depression, and hasn't changed much since.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pension reserves, on the other hand, made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade, when they skyrocketed.</seg>
<seg id="6">And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms.</seg>
<seg id="7">That's some of what emerges from the following charts, which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some results are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="9">But other figures are surprising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Housing, for instance, has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade -- although common wisdom would have expected an increase. "There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth," says Edward N. Wolff, professor of economics at New York University. "But it hasn't increased much relative to other assets.</seg>
<seg id="11">It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets.</seg>
<seg id="12">And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major {growing} household asset, isn't."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, investors' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady; stocks' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market, and not a shift in stock-holding preferences. "Stocks have not spread to the general public, despite the fact that the environment is much different," concludes Robert Avery, an economist at Cornell University. "To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets, we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="14">-- The charts show how househld assets have been distributed over time.</seg>
<seg id="15">The main components of the various asseet categories:</seg>
<seg id="16">Housing: Primary home, but not the land it's on.</seg>
<seg id="17">Land and Other Real Estate: Land on which primary home is built, investment property.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consumer Durables: Automobiles, appliances, furniture.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bank Deposits: Currency, checking-account deposits, small savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, money-market fund shares.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bonds: Excludes bond funds.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stocks/Mutual Funds: Stocks and mutual funds other than money-market funds.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unincorporated Business: Partnerships and sole proprietorships, professional corporations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Pension Reserves: Holdings by pension funds.</seg>

<seg id="2">"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.</seg>
<seg id="7">"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.</seg>
<seg id="8">The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal Reserve critics used to complain of "stop and go" monetary policies.</seg>
<seg id="2">They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt.</seg>
<seg id="3">But under Alan Greenspan that has changed.</seg>
<seg id="4">A supremely cautious man, the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, his caution has become legendary within the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">After thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed, and when he finally decides to act, his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small.</seg>
<seg id="8">Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he refused, claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed's ranks.</seg>
<seg id="12">A "senior Fed official" spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times, saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement angered Chairman Greenspan, but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">And, while the mutinous Fed member hasn't gone public, some Fed governors, most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan, who is mistakenly seen as the source.</seg>
<seg id="16">At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that "Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement." Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Fed chairman's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market's plunge, when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets.</seg>
<seg id="18">A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system.</seg>
<seg id="19">And, by the end of that week, the key federal funds interest rate, which is largely controlled by the Fed, had settled at 8.75%, barely changed from the level of just under 9% that prevailed the previous week.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault.</seg>
<seg id="21">Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates.</seg>
<seg id="22">Those concerns aren't expressed in public.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds, fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market's jitters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Still, the split is there.</seg>
<seg id="25">The administration's concerns are understandable.</seg>
<seg id="26">The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="27">Exports, which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years, seem to have stalled.</seg>
<seg id="28">Factory payrolls and production fell in September, and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch.</seg>
<seg id="29">But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road.</seg>
<seg id="31">Inflation may be stable at the moment, running at about 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="32">But if the Fed eases too soon, Mr. Greenspan fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, if the Fed holds tight, it may be able gradually to reduce inflation, moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week.</seg>
<seg id="34">So far, Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well.</seg>
<seg id="35">His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. "We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems," says David Hale, an economist of Kemper Financial Services. "I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating."</seg>
<seg id="36">But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Fed's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession, perhaps starting early next year.</seg>
<seg id="38">If that happens, Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already, Congress is toying with legislation to curb the Fed's independence.</seg>
<seg id="40">If the economy turns down, such proposals could gain strong momentum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising</seg>
<seg id="2">At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="11">The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.</seg>
<seg id="13">The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.</seg>
<seg id="17">Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.</seg>
<seg id="21">In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.</seg>
<seg id="23">Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.</seg>
<seg id="24">The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.</seg>
<seg id="25">The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.</seg>
<seg id="26">The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Whether or not "great cases make bad-law" -- as Justice Holmes asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history?</seg>
<seg id="2">Ethan Bronner's "Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America" (Norton, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious.</seg>
<seg id="4">What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power, in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic, with piquant character portrayal, hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way.</seg>
<seg id="7">I doubt that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments, the contingency plans in place, and Mr. Bork's paper trail of vulnerable writings, it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Mr. Bronner himself says, the smell of "raw meat" was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="10">Perhaps because they won, Mr. Bork's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ralph Neas was the organizing genius, whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force.</seg>
<seg id="12">Harvard's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy, laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of "Robert Bork's America" -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sen. Kennedy, never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground, emoted brilliantly.</seg>
<seg id="15">I add two others.</seg>
<seg id="16">Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others.</seg>
<seg id="17">It achieved a good media play, and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of "conscience." Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin, who in the New York Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of "original intent." The charge of being "outside the mainstream" of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork's scholarly standing, leaving him bleeding on the platform.</seg>
<seg id="18">The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections.</seg>
<seg id="20">Demographics converged with "mainstream" and demonizing to seal Robert Bork's fate.</seg>
<seg id="21">The upshot?</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Bork's opponents chose the battlefield, held it and kept it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, an "80 percenter" only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war.</seg>
<seg id="24">Another upshot, however, was the chilling message the Bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent.</seg>
<seg id="25">The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey, with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unfortunately, the author simply doesn't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents.</seg>
<seg id="27">He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture.</seg>
<seg id="28">Probing more deeply into the doctrine of "judicial restraint," he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="29">He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel, a subtle constitutional scholar, Mr. Bork's closest friend at Yale, whose influence on the judge goes well beyond Mr. Bronner's reporting.</seg>
<seg id="30">Still, the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one.</seg>
<seg id="31">His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine, which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unfortunately, Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere.</seg>
<seg id="33">The question of segregated schools, in Brown vs.</seg>
<seg id="34">Board of Education, was such an issue.</seg>
<seg id="35">In our time abortion has become another, best left to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures.</seg>
<seg id="36">A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the Griswold case) to abortion as well.</seg>
<seg id="37">One can understand Mr. Bork's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it.</seg>
<seg id="38">What is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus, it will be at their peril.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the same time, a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal, said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along, particularly this month's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit.</seg>
<seg id="4">He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year, though it probably won't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill.</seg>
<seg id="5">He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal.</seg>
<seg id="6">For individuals, the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1, 1989.</seg>
<seg id="9">As an alternative, he said, taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index.</seg>
<seg id="10">For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.</seg>
<seg id="11">That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Packwood plan would also include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax.</seg>
<seg id="15">For their part, the group of Democrats are working on a plan that, like the Packwood proposal, would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held.</seg>
<seg id="17">An extra exclusion would be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up.</seg>
<seg id="18">No one in the Senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the House.</seg>
<seg id="19">That plan would provide a 30% exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1/2-year period ending Dec. 31, 1991.</seg>
<seg id="20">After then, the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28% and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Senators are focusing on making a capital-gains differential permanent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Separately, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee said he didn't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">The current debt limit expires Oct. 31.</seg>
<seg id="24">He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit, including the House-passed capital-gains provision.</seg>

<seg id="1">The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden, deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly isn't the sort of area one would choose to visit.</seg>
<seg id="2">But turn into the shopping center's parking lot, and one could be in the safe, busy mall of a prosperous suburb.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only it is safer, and busier.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the past year there have been only one burglary, three thefts of or from autos, no purse-snatchings, and one attempted robbery in the mall, which opened in late 1981.</seg>
<seg id="5">A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would, per year, be expected to have eight burglaries, 70 thefts of or from autos, and four robberies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $350 per leasable square foot; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $200.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern, in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth, gangs, and the criminal element, with an erosion of the customer base, development capital, and insurability.</seg>
<seg id="9">Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices.</seg>
<seg id="10">Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">This defensible commercial zone becomes, for the residents, a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape, evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible.</seg>
<seg id="13">The center improves the community image to outsiders as well, and may help to arrest, or even reverse, the exodus of capital and investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">An additional benefit is the creation of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="15">This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers.</seg>
<seg id="16">It continues through the life of the center; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $2,500 per job.</seg>
<seg id="17">As many of these jobs are filled by local residents, who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls, the $2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="18">And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales, real estate, licenses and the like.</seg>
<seg id="19">Profits are also plowed back into the community; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60% of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bradford Crowe, director of the mayor's City Economic Development Office, says: "There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock, thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago's Third Ward, opposite the Robert Taylor Homes, 29% of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups.</seg>
<seg id="24">Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins.</seg>
<seg id="25">So what's the catch?</seg>
<seg id="26">Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time, patience, breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess.</seg>
<seg id="27">Security costs are also quite high.</seg>
<seg id="28">One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies, local political leaders, and citizen groups, and with prospective tenants and sources of financing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them.</seg>
<seg id="30">Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive, but unobtrusive.</seg>
<seg id="31">The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates.</seg>
<seg id="32">Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance.</seg>
<seg id="33">Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard.</seg>
<seg id="34">The security command post, camouflaged as second-story retail space, has its own "crow's nest" above the roofs of the other buildings, with a panoramic view of the entire center.</seg>
<seg id="35">Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center.</seg>
<seg id="36">These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group's Grand Boulevard Plaza.</seg>
<seg id="37">Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center.</seg>
<seg id="38">Security is 60% to 70% of the common area charges of these centers, vs. an industry average of about 15%.</seg>
<seg id="39">These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers' site acquisition, construction, and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants, Economic Development Administration Grants, Community Development Block Grants, tax-free Industrial Development Bonds, Enterprise Zone tax write-offs, city infrastructure grants, and tax increment financing.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many of these programs no longer exist, or have been severely cut back.</seg>
<seg id="41">However, since these centers appear to pay for themselves, there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions.</seg>
<seg id="42">Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives, loans, and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities.</seg>
<seg id="43">These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning, identifying sources of funds, and for acquiring a site and preparing it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date.</seg>
<seg id="45">With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers, inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment.</seg>
<seg id="46">New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets.</seg>
<seg id="47">If the risks and rewards are reasonable, developers will respond.</seg>
<seg id="48">Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="49">The answer will be obvious.</seg>

<seg id="1">Raymond Chandler, in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book, likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher.</seg>
<seg id="2">When the champ has lost his stuff, the great mystery novelist wrote, "when he can no longer throw the high hard one, he throws his heart instead.</seg>
<seg id="3">He throws something.</seg>
<seg id="4">He doesn't just walk off the mound and weep."</seg>
<seg id="5">Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career.</seg>
<seg id="6">His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe, the inferior "Playback" (1958), at times read almost like a parody of his previous work.</seg>
<seg id="7">When he died in 1959, Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book, "The Poodle Springs Story," which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque. "Champ" Chandler's last pitch, apparently, was a screwball.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Robert Parker, author of several best sellers featuring Spenser, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete "The Poodle Springs Story." The result, "Poodle Springs" (Putnam's, 288 pages, $18.95) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color.</seg>
<seg id="9">If it does not quite have Chandler's special magic -- well, at the end, neither did Chandler.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the book begins, a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle (a.k.a.</seg>
<seg id="11">Palm) Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood.</seg>
<seg id="12">His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring, a character who also appeared in Chandler's "The Long Goodbye" and "Playback." Philip and Linda move into her mansion and can't keep their hands off each other, even in front of the Hawaiian/Japanese houseman.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the lovebirds have a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="14">He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye, and she wants him to live off the million dollars she's settled on him.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's Chandler's setup.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life, Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds.</seg>
<seg id="17">The supporting lineup is solid, the patter is amusing and there's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls, the "good cop" of previous Chandler books who still doesn't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler's prose at its most pared down.</seg>
<seg id="19">All told, Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there are grounds for complaint.</seg>
<seg id="21">At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro.</seg>
<seg id="22">More bothersome, there are several apparent anachronisms.</seg>
<seg id="23">Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="24">A little more care in re-creating Marlowe's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable.</seg>

<seg id="1">As an actor, Charles Lane isn't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin's spirit.</seg>
<seg id="2">Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp.</seg>

<seg id="7">So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.</seg>

<seg id="9">Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of Mr. Lane's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit).</seg>
<seg id="11">Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill, the New York streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem benign.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers, magicians and other good-natured hustlers. (This clearly is not real life: no crack dealers, no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan, no one curled up in a cardboard box.)</seg>
<seg id="14">The Artist has his routine.</seg>
<seg id="15">He spends his days sketching passers-by, or trying to.</seg>
<seg id="16">At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home.</seg>
<seg id="17">His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems carefree.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is his own man.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in "City Lights," the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif (Nicole Alysia), whose father has been murdered by thugs, to her mother.</seg>
<seg id="20">This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse.</seg>
<seg id="21">She gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.</seg>
<seg id="22">The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night.</seg>
<seg id="23">To further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who owns her own children's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="24">This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Lane's final purpose isn't to glamorize the Artist's vagabond existence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He has a point he wants to make, and he makes it, with a great deal of force.</seg>
<seg id="27">The movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices.</seg>
<seg id="28">The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "Story of Women." He has made a harsh, brilliant picture -- one that's captivating -- about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet this woman, Marie-Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government's hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="30">While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.</seg>
<seg id="31">Marie-Louise, a small-time abortionist, was their woman.</seg>
<seg id="32">She became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her to buy jam, cocoa and other war-rationed goodies.</seg>
<seg id="33">She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her remorse was shallow and brief.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home.</seg>
<seg id="36">As presented by Mr. Chabrol, and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert, Marie-Louise (called Marie Latour in the film) was not a nice person.</seg>
<seg id="37">But she didn't deserve to have her head chopped off.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is very little to recommend "Old Gringo," a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.</seg>
<seg id="40">I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die.</seg>
<seg id="41">Video Tip: Before seeing "Sidewalk Stories," take a look at "City Lights," Chaplin's Tramp at his finest.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. should double A.I. funding</seg>
<seg id="2">As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.</seg>
<seg id="3">The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="18">And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.</seg>

<seg id="4">President Bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto.</seg>
<seg id="5">Vice President Quayle and Budget Director Darman said recently they've joined the search.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Tuesday, the subject came up again when Marlin Fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the White House press corps.</seg>
<seg id="7">President Bush doesn't have any provision in mind, but line-item-veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing Resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that Mr. Bush's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since 1987, when lawyer Stephen Glazier first made the case on this page.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 1974 budget "reform," passed over President Nixon's veto, took away the presidential impoundment power, thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop.</seg>
<seg id="12">Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 says that whether it's called an "order, resolution or vote" or anything else, Presidents must have the chance to veto.</seg>
<seg id="13">Labeling an omnibus budget a "bill" can't deprive the President of his power to veto items.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finding a test case shouldn't be hard, but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The White House had the perfect case, but Congress blinked before it could go to court.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the HUD and S&L stories broke, some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="17">They worried about an Interior Department directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation: "None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff."</seg>
<seg id="19">The White House warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto, Congress caved.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, "This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989." This means Interior contacts cannot be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed.</seg>
<seg id="22">If the White House is looking for another unconstitutional bill, Rep. John Dingell is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead.</seg>
<seg id="23">President Reagan vetoed this as a First Amendment violation.</seg>
<seg id="24">The "Fairness" Doctrine's enthusiasts are incumbents in the House who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts, deterring feisty challengers.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen to join treaty-negotiating teams and new restrictions on OMB.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets, but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="27">Commenting on the budget mess this week, President Bush said: "The perception out there is that it's the fault of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="28">And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people." Exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now's the time to make the political case that Presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="30">Congress is in no position to naysay Mr. Bush now that we're into Gramm-Rudman's sequestration.</seg>
<seg id="31">Just this week, the House-Senate conference met -- 231 conferees, divided into 26 different subconferences.</seg>
<seg id="32">Senator Daniel Inouye agreed to close some bases in Hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $11 million for a parking lot at Walter Reed Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="33">Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $40 million in military bases for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $70 million for bases in Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work.</seg>
<seg id="35">He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork.</seg>
<seg id="36">Congress may have lost any sense of discipline, but that doesn't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess.</seg>
<seg id="37">President Bush has the power to change how Washington works, if only he will use it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.</seg>
<seg id="6">The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."</seg>
<seg id="7">Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.</seg>
<seg id="10">The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.</seg>
<seg id="14">Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.</seg>
<seg id="18">If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."</seg>
<seg id="22">A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.</seg>
<seg id="23">Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.</seg>
<seg id="26">A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.</seg>

<seg id="3">Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his score in the 65th minute.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.</seg>
<seg id="5">He raced between three Brighton defenders, before slashing into the open field.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.</seg>
<seg id="7">He pushed around one defender before outrunning several more at the edge of the Brighton box.</seg>
<seg id="8">He then pushed a pass to his left, finding Sterling.</seg>
<seg id="9">The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We spoke about him playing 55, 60 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="15">That goal came in the 29th minute.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the results of the international cooperation in excise duty administration audits between the Czech and the Slovak Republic in 2006</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="3">The joint report presents information about the course and result of international cooperation in parallel audits performed by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic, and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, focused on excise duty administration after the accession of both countries into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation was performed pursuant to the Agreement on Audit Cooperation signed in February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parallel audits were chosen with respect to radical changes in the excise duty collection system as a result of the accession of the Czech and Slovak Republic into the EU internal market as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="6">The functioning of the EU internal market requires free movement of goods, including excisable goods.</seg>
<seg id="7">The basic principle is to enable circulation of tax-free goods up to the date of their presentation for end use.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new legislation adopted in both countries enables movement of goods under tax supervision under the duty-suspension arrangement in accordance with the aforementioned principle.</seg>
<seg id="9">The system imposes high requirements on tax authorities and anticipates mutual cooperation of particular administrative authorities of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="10">Report on the result of the international cooperation in excise duty administration audits in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="12">Audit No: (CR) 05/34 (SR) 48/11</seg>
<seg id="13">Subject of audit: (CR) Excise duty administration (SR) Customs authorities procedures in excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="14">The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter only „SAO, CR“), and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter only „ SAO SR“) concluded an Agreement on Audit Cooperation (hereinafter only „the Agreement“) on 8 February 2006.</seg>
<seg id="15">The subject of the Agreement was cooperation in parallelly performed audits of „Excise duty administration“ included in the Audit plan of the SAO, CR for 2005, No. 05/34 and „Customs procedures in excise duty administration“ included in the SAO SR Audit plan for 2006, No. 48/11.</seg>
<seg id="16">Parallel audits had the nature of a coordinated audit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cooperation consisted both, in the exchange of information that could not be obtained by Parties to the Agreement in course of excise duty administration audit on the territory of the respective state, and in drafting the joint final report on the result of audits in accordance with the European Implementing Guidelines for the INTOSAI Auditing Standard No 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">The audit on the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter only „the CR“) was performed by audit teams composed of representatives of the State Budget Department and of the regional offices in the Central Bohemia, South Bohemia, West Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia, and North Moravia from 7 February to 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">The audit was performed by 27 auditors.</seg>
<seg id="20">One of the audited entities was the General Directorate of Customs (hereinafter only „the DGC“) and 11 tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="21">12 out of 54 customs offices of the DGC were selected for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="22">The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter only „the SR“) was performed by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO sub-offices in Banská Bystrica and Košice in 5 out of the total number of 9 regional customs offices between 13 February and 2 June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit was performed by 8 auditors.</seg>
<seg id="24">The objective of parallel audits was to check procedures of the customs authorities in excise duty administration, as well as adherence to valid legislation in both countries and in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="25">The international cooperation was aimed at the procedures of tax authorities in supervising movement of excisable goods, specifically at the register of started and ended movements of products under the duty-suspension arrangement, as well as on information exchange in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between Czech and Slovak tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="26">2. Excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="27">Before 31 December 2003, the excise duty administration in the CR was performed by tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="28">This responsibility was taken over on 1 January 2004 by the customs authorities that were only responsible for the collection of excise duty on import before that.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the CR, the excise duty is applicable to mineral oils, spirits, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="30">The 2004 state budget revenue from excise duty amounted to 82,2 billion CZK, which represents 19,5 % of the total revenue of 424,7 billion CZK from duties and charges.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duty amounted to 103,6 billion CZK, which is 22,5 % of the total revenue of 460,4 billion CZK from duties and charges.</seg>
<seg id="32">The revenue from excise duty on mineral oils represented 80 % of the total revenue of excise tax in 2004 and in 2005 it was 90,9 %.</seg>
<seg id="33">The remainder of the revenue, e.g. 13,0 billion CZK in 2004 and 6,9 billion CZK in 2005, represented the revenue of the Transport Infrastructure State Fund.</seg>
<seg id="34">Customs authorities became administrators of the excise duty in the SR on 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty from mineral oils, which they have been managing since 1. January 2002.</seg>
<seg id="35">Previously, tax authorities carried out the excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the SR, mineral oils, beer, wine, tobacco products and spirits are subject to the excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="37">The state budget revenue from excise duty in 2004 in the SR amounted to 43,4 billion SKK, which is 20,7 % of the total tax revenue of 209,5 bill. SKK.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duty amounted to 50,0 billion SKK, which is 22,5% of the total tax revenue of 222,6 billion SKK.</seg>
<seg id="39">Graph 1 - Comparison of the state budget revenue of the CR from taxes and charges and the state budget tax revenue of the SR to the excise tax revenue</seg>

<seg id="41">The basic legal norm regulating the field of excise duty in the CR is the Act No. 353/2003 Coll. on excise duty as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 353/2003 Coll.”), which came into effect on 1 January 2004.</seg>
<seg id="42">The customs authorities in the SR are inter alia governed by the following generally binding legal regulations: - Act No. 98/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on mineral oil as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 98/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 104/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on wine as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 104/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 105/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on spirit as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 105/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 106/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on tobacco products as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 106/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 107/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on beer as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 107/2004 Coll.”).</seg>
<seg id="43">2.1 Movement of excisable products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="44">Conditions of the movement of excisable products under the duty-suspension arrangement are governed by the Council Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III - Movement of goods, Arts. 15 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="45">Under these provisions, the movement of products can only be performed by an authorised warehousekeeper. That is a physical or legal entity with granted permission by respective authorities of the Member States to produce, process, hold, receipt or dispatch products subject to excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="46">The consignee in another member state may be an authorised warehouse keeper or trader without the authorised warehousekeeper status who is not allowed either hold or dispatch products under excise-duty suspension arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="47">An authorised warehouse keeper in the CR and SR means a tax warehouse operator. A trader is an authorised consignee of repeated or single receipt of products liable to excise.</seg>
<seg id="48">The movement of excisable products under the duty-suspension arrangement is under Council Directive 92/12/EEC possible only with an accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="49">The accompanying document is issued by the consignor in four identical copies before the start of the movement, unless respective authorities of a member state of dispatch request more copies.</seg>
<seg id="50">2.2 Procedure at the start and the end of a movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the CR and SR</seg>
<seg id="51">Movement from the CR</seg>
<seg id="52">The procedure at the start of the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement is regulated in the provision § 25 (3) Act No. 353/2003 Coll., where the following is indicated:</seg>
<seg id="53">“The operator that dispatches selected products from the tax warehouse is obliged to notify the customs office with the appropriate territorial competence before the start of the movement of the selected product;</seg>
<seg id="54">the movement of products can only start upon the approval of the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="55">The customs office issues approval of the movement of selected products without delay upon a deposit of guarantee to secure the tax ...”</seg>
<seg id="56">The consignor in the CR can only start the movement of any type of excisable products upon approval of the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="57">The customs office grants such approval only when the guarantee to secure the tax has been deposited in the amount equal to the tax on transported products.</seg>
<seg id="58">The consignor is obliged to issue the accompanying document in five copies before the start of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="59">The customs office indicates its approval to start the movement on the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="60">The copy 1 is kept by the consignor, the copies 2, 3, and 4 are given to the transporter and the copy 5 is kept by the customs office which approved the movement.</seg>
<seg id="61">Under the Slovak legislation, the consignee in the SR keeps the copy 2 of the accompanying document, he confirms taking over the products on the copies 3 and 4 and presents both copies to the competent customs office.</seg>
<seg id="62">The copy 3 validated by the customs office, is sent to the consignor no later than the 15th day of the subsequent calendar month from when the transfer began.</seg>
<seg id="63">The copy 4 is kept by the customs office of the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="64">The movement of products is ended when taken over by the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="65">The customs office in the CR which approved of the movement to commence discharges the guarantee within 5 working days since the date of presentation of copy 3 of the accompanying document, which is validated by the consignee and the Slovak customs office.</seg>
<seg id="66">Graph 2 - Circulation of accompanying document when the movement started in the CR and ended in the SR</seg>
<seg id="67">Movement from the SR</seg>
<seg id="68">Before 31 December 2005, the procedure at the movement of spirits and tobacco products from SR to another EU member state was regulated in the following manner:</seg>
<seg id="69">Pursuant to the provision of § 26 (4) Act No 105/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="70">“During the transportation of spirits from the tax warehouse in the tax territory to the tax warehouse or to a registered trader, or to authorized tax representative in another Member State, the consignor (supplier) is obliged on the day of start of the transportation to send a copy of the copy 1 of the accompanying document via fax or electronically the Customs Office Poprad; the consignor (supplier) is obliged to send this copy in written form also to the customs office no later than 5 working days after the day of the start of the transportation”.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pursuant to the provision of § 22 para 4 Act No. 106/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="72">“During the transport of tobacco products from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to the tax warehouse or registered trader, or authorized tax consignee in another Member State the consignor (supplier) is obliged to on the day of the beginning of the transport dispatch a copy of copy 1 of accompanying document electronically or by fax to the Customs Office Poprad; it is also obliged to dispatch this copy in written form no later than 5 working days after the day of the beginning of the transport”.</seg>
<seg id="73">Between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, (hereinafter referred to as the “audited period”), the tax entity was not obliged to notify the Customs Office Poprad or a respective customs office about the start of the movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement of other excisable products (mineral oils, wine and beer).</seg>
<seg id="74">The tax authority learned about such movements from accompanying documents and accounting documents of the tax entity only during on-the-spot investigations or tax audits.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the SR, the consignor is obliged to issue the accompanying document in four copies before the start of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="76">The copy 1 is kept by the consignor (he sends copy 1 electronically or by fax to the Customs Office Poprad and to the respective customs office when spirits and tobacco products are transported).</seg>
<seg id="77">The copies 2, 3, and 4 accompany the transported products.</seg>
<seg id="78">In accordance with the Czech legislation the consignee in the CR keeps the copy 2 of the accompanying document issued by the consignor in the SR and certifies the receipt of goods on the copies 3 and 4.</seg>
<seg id="79">The certified copies 3 and 4 shall be sent to the competent customs office in the CR no later than on the first working day after the movement ended.</seg>
<seg id="80">The customs office keeps copies 4, and returns validated copy 3 to consignee.</seg>
<seg id="81">The consignee sends certified copy 3 to consignor in SR at the latest on the first working day after its receipt.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the SR, the movement is considered to be complete on the date of receipt of products by the consignee.</seg>
<seg id="83">The end of the movement is proved by the consignor presenting the copy 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and the tax authority in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="84">Graph 3 - Circulation of the accompanying document at the movement of products (spirits and tobacco products) started in the SR and ended in the CR</seg>
<seg id="85">All the Slovak acts on excise duty were gradually amended in 2006. According to these legal norms the consignor of products under the duty-suspension arrangement is obliged to send the copy 1 of the accompanying document by e-mail or fax to a competent customs office where the consignor resides.</seg>
<seg id="86">The copy 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and respective tax authority proves the delivery of spirits and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="87">The copy 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee proves the ending of the movement of mineral oils, wine and beer.</seg>
<seg id="88">The certificate of receipt issued by a tax authority of other member state is required when the tax authority is obliged to issue such a certificate on the copy 3 of the accompanying document under the legislation of the respective member state.</seg>
<seg id="89">2.3 Register of started and ended movements managed by the Czech and the Slovak Customs Authorities</seg>
<seg id="90">There is currently no single computer system established for monitoring the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="91">However, the European Parliament and the Council Decision 1152/2003/ES of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products imposes on Member States and the European Commission to implement a computerised system (Excise Movement and Control System) by 1 July 2009. This system would enable tax authorities in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the movement of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="92">The system shall enable electronic transmission of the accompanying documents, which only have existed in the hard copy form so far. This would help simplify the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement and improve the control of duty free products in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="93">National databases of the Member States on the movement of products will be part of this system.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Customs Administration of the CR records all movements starting and ending within the Czech territory in the Record of Selected Products module (hereinafter only “RSP”).</seg>
<seg id="95">All the Czech customs offices have online access to this system.</seg>
<seg id="96">Tax authorities may obtain information about the start or the end of the movements carried out only within the territory of the CR as soon as the customs office enters the accompanying document into the RSP record.</seg>
<seg id="97">When the customs office of the consignee enters the end of the movement to RSP, the customs office discharges the guarantee covering the duty on the goods deposited by consignor.</seg>
<seg id="98">Customs offices in the SR use the software database based on the SysNed application, for the automation of their processes of the excise duty administration and for communicating with EU systems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Data on registration of a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator, or an authorised consignee entered in the SysNed application are automatically transmitted to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="100">3. Preparation and course of cooperation</seg>
<seg id="101">The first co-ordination meeting of the representatives of the SAO, CR and the SAO SR took place in January 2006, where parallel audits of the excise duty administration were discussed.</seg>
<seg id="102">Both Parties informed each other about the legislation on excise duty and the organisation of the excise duty administration in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="103">Special attention was paid to the procedures of the Czech and Slovak Customs Authorities in granting permission, starts and ends of movements of products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States and exchange of information between tax authorities administering the excise duty in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="104">In the meeting it was agreed that the Czech and the Slovak Party: - shall specify data on excisable products transported between the CR and the SR, started in the audited period, - shall compare data on movements of mineral oils, CN heading 2710 and 2711 and spirits CN heading 2207 and 2208 under the duty-suspension arrangement between the CR and the SR, in November 2004 and September 2005.</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was expanded by including October and November 2005 and by the movement of tobacco products under the duty-suspension arrangement in these months.</seg>
<seg id="106">Tables 1 and 2 indicate the total amount of products subject to excise duty, which were transported under the duty-suspension arrangement between the Czech and Slovak tax entities in the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="107">4. Comparison of registers of the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement</seg>
<seg id="108">The SAO, CR handed over the database of movements ending in the Czech territory to the Slovak Party. It contained a total of 5,876 items from the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items referred to mineral oils, 134 items referred to spirits and 4 items to tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="109">The SAO SR handed over the database of movements ending in the SR to the Czech Party. The database contained a total of 3,319 items from the accompanying documents, of which 696 items referred to mineral oil, 2,066 items referred to spirits and 557 items to tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="110">The SAO, CR made a comparison of the data in the Register of the movements started in the CR with the data on movements ended in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="111">The results of this comparison are indicated in the Table 3:</seg>
<seg id="112">The SAO, CR compared data on movements in November 2004 and September 2005 with the Database of the Slovak Customs submitted by the SAO SR at the beginning of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="113">The database did not contain accurate data making it difficult to rely upon the confirmation of individual movements and thus only 63 % of started movements were confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="114">Individual movements were confirmed on the basis of various data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transportation, amount of transported products.</seg>
<seg id="115">The SAO, CR compared data on movements in October and November 2005 started in the CR and ended in the SR with the Slovak Customs Database. Since all the data in the Database were in accordance with the accompanying documents, 93 % of started movements were confirmed outright.</seg>
<seg id="116">In the Czech Customs Database the volume of mineral oil was indicated in litres or tonnes, depending on the type of mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="117">The volume of spirits was in the majority of cases indicated in litres, which could be converted to litres of 100 % alcohol by the alcohol content percentage indicated in the Database.</seg>
<seg id="118">The volume of tobacco products was indicated in pieces, in thousands pcs or kg by start or the type of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="119">The accompanying documents were checked in cases when movements that started in the CR could not have their end confirmed with certainty in the Slovak Database, or when figures on volume of transported goods did not match.</seg>
<seg id="120">The accompanying documents were checked in 487 cases concerning the movement of spirits, mineral oils and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="121">Documents were checked in customs offices where the SAO, CR pursued its audit.</seg>
<seg id="122">In cases where movements were approved by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested via the General Directorate of Customs.</seg>
<seg id="123">The Czech Party requested the Slovak Party to verify 141 movements where there was no certified copy 3 of the accompanying document attached by the Czech Customs Authorities or the amount of products indicated in accompanying document did not match the amount in the Database.</seg>
<seg id="124">Also data on movements recorded in the Slovak Database and missing in the Czech Database were presented to the Slovak Party.</seg>
<seg id="125">The SAO SR identified 95 movements in the Slovak Customs Database.</seg>
<seg id="126">Upon request of the Supreme Audit Office to verify the remaining 46 cases, the competent customs offices presented the certified copies of the accompanying documents proving the movement's completion.</seg>
<seg id="127">The copies of the accompanying documents were passed over by the Slovak Party to the Czech Party and were used for the identification of movements in the Czech Database, with the exception of two movements performed by two Czech tax entities which were not found in the Czech Database of started movements.</seg>
<seg id="128">When auditing these cases it was found that:</seg>
<seg id="129">- 11 movements of spirits were recorded in the Slovak Database in total volume of 276,7 litres of alcohol, performed by the Czech tax entity in 2004, and 20 movements of spirits in total volume of 404,66 litres of alcohol performed in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="130">The SAO, CR found out that these movements concerned taxed products which the consignor did not need approval of the tax authorities to start their transportation for.</seg>
<seg id="131">The consignor instead notified the tax authorities in writing about the start of delivery upon possession of a duty-suspension accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="132">- In the Slovak Database, 94 movements of mineral oil (CN code 2710 11 21) were recorded with a total volume of 173 000 litres performed by the Czech tax entity in the period of September 2004 to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="133">The SAO CR found out that the tax entity performed movement of 102 000 litres of tax-free mineral oils without the respective authorisation from May 2004 to June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="134">However, the tax entity was a holder of a specific authorisation for the receipt and use of tax-free products, on the condition that the tax-free products were supplied to a holder of equal authorisation only.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tax entity did not notify the Czech customs authorities about the start of the movement and did not deposit a tax guarantee in the amount of 1,207,680 CZK.</seg>
<seg id="136">It transported 71 000 litres of taxed mineral oil from July 2005 to December 2005 to the territory of the SR and in these cases it also did not fulfil the legal obligation since it did not notify customs authorities about the start of movement.</seg>
<seg id="137">The movement of goods under the tax-free circulation in the tax territory of the CR to another Member State may be started by the consignor in the CR without an approval of the customs authority, but it is still obliged to notify customs authorities about this fact in writing before the start of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="138">The tax entity withdrawing products from the tax-free circulation in another Member State is obliged to notify the amount and deposit a guarantee to cover the tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">Movement of products can be only performed with a simplified accompanying document, whose particulars are regulated by the Commission Regulation 3649/92.</seg>
<seg id="140">This Regulation allows the use of an accompanying document for movement under the duty-suspension, but it must be clearly marked that it is a “simplified accompanying document for tax audit purposes (products subject to excise duty)”.</seg>
<seg id="141">The movement and receipt of products placed in the tax-free circulation in a Member State is also valid in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the aforementioned cases, tax entities transported products placed in the tax-free circulation with the accompanying document for movement under the duty-suspension arrangement and the consignee submitted copies 3 and 4 of this document to the tax authority in the SR for validation.</seg>
<seg id="143">The Slovak Customs recorded these movements in the Database of movements of products under the duty-suspension arrangement, as the accompanying documents were not marked as simplified.</seg>
<seg id="144">The SAO SR compared the Database of movements of the Czech Customs Administration with the SR Customs Database and found out the following:</seg>
<seg id="145">- product were recorded in the Database in different ways, for example, mineral oil was recorded in litres, hectolitres and kilograms; spirits were listed in litres or in litres of alcohol, making the comparison of transported products more difficult,</seg>
<seg id="146">- the total volume of supplied spirits documented in invoices did not match the volume recorded in the Database,</seg>
<seg id="147">- not all of the invoices were recorded in the customs administrations' Databases,</seg>
<seg id="148">- in the Slovak Customs database there were two movements of denatured spirits from the CR to the SR that were recorded separately and performed in November 2004 in total amount of 47,237 litres of alcohol. These records were not found in the Czech Customs Database.</seg>
<seg id="149">The Slovak Party forwarded the copies of related accompanying documents to the Czech Party.</seg>
<seg id="150">5. International exchange of information between the Czech and Slovak Customs Authorities</seg>
<seg id="151">Before 30 June 2005, conditions of the cooperation between administrative authorities of the Member States competent for the administration of excise duties were regulated by the Council Directive 77/799/EEC on mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums.</seg>
<seg id="152">On 1 July 2005 the Council Regulation 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties came into effect that set out rules and procedures enabling respective authorities of the Member States of the European Union cooperation and exchange of information necessary for correct assessment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="153">Each Member State identifies a central liaison office, which provides for contacts with other Member States in the field of the excise duty administration and is responsible for exchange of information on movement of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="154">In the CR the „Excise Liaison Office“ unit was created at the General Directorate of Customs for the purpose of excise information exchange between the EU Member States (hereinafter only „ELO CR “).</seg>
<seg id="155">Tasks associated with the administration of movement verification systems (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and exchange of information under mutual administrative assistance between the EU Member States and the SR were performed since 1 July 2004 by the ELO at the Customs Office Poprad.</seg>
<seg id="156">Since 1 July 2005 tasks of the ELO office are accomplished by the ELO unit located in Poprad, a part of the Division of Excise Duties of the Slovak Customs Directorate (hereinafter only „ELO SR“).</seg>
<seg id="157">Under Article 3 (3) of the Council Regulation 2073/2004 the ELO SR is responsible specially for: - exchange of data of the electronic register of the System for Exchange of Excise Data (hereinafter only „SEED“), - Early Warning System for Excise, (hereinafter only „EWSE“), - applications for movement verification of excisable products to or from other Member States (Movement Verification System, hereinafter only „MVS“).</seg>
<seg id="158">Contents, scope and functions of SEED, EWSE and MVS are regulated under the Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the Council Regulation 2073/2004.</seg>
<seg id="159">SEED - System for Exchange of Excise Data on tax entities trading in excisable goods.</seg>
<seg id="160">System consists of national registers of excise taxpayers and enables tax authorities on the territory of the European Union to find out whether excisable products are traded by persons authorised for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="161">Each national register is accessible to the respective authorities of other Member States only for the purpose of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="162">The ELO ensures in each Member State that persons involved in movement of excisable products on the EU territory could obtain confirmation of information kept in this Database.</seg>
<seg id="163">In accordance with § 41 Act No. 98/2004 Coll., § 39 Act No. 104/2004 Coll., § 46 Act No. 105/2004 Coll., § 40 Act No.106/2004 Coll., and § 39 Act No. 107/2004 Coll. the ELO SR maintains electronic database with the register of warehouse operators, authorised consignees and tax warehouses - the SEED Database.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Slovak Customs Authorities contribute to the SEED by feeding data on registered tax warehouses, warehouse operators or authorised consignees into the SysNed application, which is directly connected to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="165">It means that if there is a new warehouse operator or an authorised consignee or a tax warehouse entered into the SysNed, the respective data are automatically transmitted to the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="166">The SAO SR established that exchange of SEED files between the Slovak and Czech customs authorities took place normally once a month and exceptionally more times a month during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Slovak Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.</seg>
<seg id="168">In the CR the data are fed into the SEED from the national register of persons authorised to handle excisable products and the register of issued authorisations on handling these products.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Czech customs offices do not have access to the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="170">Applications of customs offices to obtain information from the SEED Database of other Member States are presented to and obtained via the ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="171">EWSE - Early Warning System is aimed at checking movement of excisable products and it also notifies about movement of high-risk consignments.</seg>
<seg id="172">As a high-risk consignment is designated the movement of some excisable products in amount exceeding limits set by the Commission Regulation and movements which are classified as high-risk by the tax authority.</seg>
<seg id="173">Information exchange is made in two forms:</seg>
<seg id="174">- informative message - sent in case where amount of products exceeds set limits,</seg>
<seg id="175">- warning message - sent where risk analysis classifies certain movement of products as high risk.</seg>
<seg id="176">To identify the level of risk the ELO SR uses the SEED Database to verify data in the accompanying document and to send a warning message.</seg>
<seg id="177">When data in the SEED Database differ from the data in the accompanying document (e.g. different registration number of the consignee or domicile of the consignee), the ELO SR sends a warning message to the ELO of the Member State competent for the products recipient.</seg>
<seg id="178">While drafting messages the ELO SR abides by Commission Regulations CED 317 and CED 457 for tax and customs business, which inter alia establish the type and volume of products in measurement units for the purposes of informative and warning messages.</seg>
<seg id="179">During the audited period, the ELO SR sent one warning message to the ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the CR information on started movements of products in volume exceeding set limit are generated automatically upon entry of data from the accompanying document to the Database after the approval of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="181">If the tax authority in the CR classifies the consignment as high-risk following its own analysis, drafts a warning message and sends it via the ELO CR to the respective Member State.</seg>
<seg id="182">In 2005 the ELO CR sent two warning messages to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="183">MVS - Movement Verification System enables to verify movements of excisable products on presentation of application and to verify notified transport route between entities indicated on the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="184">Information exchange takes place on the basis of application in which the ELO of the country of dispatch specifies its requirements.</seg>
<seg id="185">This system is used mainly in cases where a consignor takes over the certified copy 3 of the accompanying document and requests excise repayment, for example, or in cases when data in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="186">In the audited period the ELO SR sent 33 applications for the MVS to the ELO CR.</seg>
<seg id="187">The ELO CR sent 25 applications for the MVS to the ELO SR.</seg>
<seg id="188">The Czech Customs Offices most often verified data in accompanying documents, specially volume of received or dispatched products, and authorisation of the consignor to handle excisable products, when this information could not be verified in the international database SEED.</seg>
<seg id="189">Applications received by the MVS were forwarded in both countries to customs authorities competent for the consignee or consignor of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="190">Customs Authorities verified requested data and sent the result of verification to the ELO of the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="191">6. SUMMARY</seg>
<seg id="192">The cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR enabled comparison of legislation governing the field of excise duties in both countries, procedures of the Czech and Slovak Customs Authorities at the start and end of the movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement between both countries, registration of movements and also comparison of information exchanged between Customs Authorities under international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="193">6.1 Comparing legislation on excise duty in the CR and the SR the following differences were established in:</seg>
<seg id="194">a) procedures of tax entities and tax authorities at the start of movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="195">In the CR a tax entity can initiate movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement only with the approval of a tax authority, which grants such approval only if a potential tax on transported products has been guaranteed in full amount.</seg>
<seg id="196">Whereas, in the SR the start of the movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement is not liable to approval of tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="197">During the audited period, a tax entity had to notify tax authorities about the start of the movement of spirits and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="198">Movement of mineral oils, beer and wine could start without notifying tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2006 in the SR amendments of all Acts on excise duty were adopted, whereby the consignor of products under the duty-suspension arrangement was obliged to send the copy 1 of the accompanying document before the start of the movement by e-mail or fax to the consignor's appropriate customs authority.</seg>
<seg id="200">b) deadlines for submitting the copy 3 of the accompanying document.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the CR the consignee is obliged to send the copies 3 and 4 to tax authorities for verification no later than next working day after the date of the end of the movement.</seg>

<seg id="205">Neither the content nor the form of register is regulated by legal norms in the CR or the SR.</seg>
<seg id="206">The customs authorities of both countries enter all data from accompanying documents into the register on the basis of which the movement is realized.</seg>
<seg id="207">At present, there is no single system for monitoring of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States which would enable tax authorities in particular states to obtain information on the movement in real time.</seg>
<seg id="208">The decision of the European Parliament and Council No. 1152/2003/EC of 16 June 2003 envisages implementation of an electronic movement monitoring system for excisable goods since 1 July 2009.</seg>
<seg id="209">On the basis of the Agreement the Czech Party handed over to the Slovak Party a database of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement started in the SR and ended in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Database contained 5 876 items of transported mineral oils, spirits and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="211">The Slovak Party handed over to the Czech Party a database of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement started in the CR and ended in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="212">The Database contained 3 319 items of transported mineral oils, spirits and tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="213">The Czech Party compared data on movements in the register of movements started in the CR with the register of movements ended in the SR.</seg>
<seg id="214">The Slovak Party matched data on movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement started in the SR and ended in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="215">The data comparison was difficult due to the fact, that a lot of transported products were not indicated in the Databases in a unified manner.</seg>
<seg id="216">In cases where it was impossible to clearly identify and match data on particular movements, verification of accompanying documents was performed. In course of verifications neither violations of conditions of movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement nor tax evasions were established.</seg>
<seg id="217">On the bases of information obtained from parallel audits it may be stated that the register of movements is a source of good information needed for enhancement of the excise tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="218">Development of an electronic system for movement and monitoring of excisable products pursuant to the Decision of the European Parliament and Council No. 1152/2003 EC enables the electronic transmission of an accompanying document and more efficient verification of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement on the territory of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is an American Secretary of State seriously suggesting that the Khmer Rouge should help govern Cambodia?</seg>
<seg id="2">Apparently so.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are no easy choices in Cambodia, but we can't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army, the State Department is talking again about accepting an "interim" coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh.</seg>
<seg id="5">The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen regime, the two non-communist resistance groups led by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk, and the Khmer Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="6">The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power.</seg>
<seg id="7">The State Department says that any Khmer Rouge participation would have to be "minimal."</seg>
<seg id="8">The usual problem with including communists in "interim" coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="9">Recall that Nicaragua's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within two years, the moderates were exiled or in prison, Nicaragua had gone communist, and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Laos, when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even Mao Tse-tung's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="15">That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Hun Sen regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building Cambodia's equivalent of the Berlin Wall near the Thai border.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Khmer Rouge, however, carry an unsurpassed record for Cambodian tyranny.</seg>
<seg id="18">These utopians caused the deaths -- by starvation, disease or execution -- of well over one million Cambodians.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief.</seg>
<seg id="20">The world might want to believe that the Khmer Rouge can't still be such bad guys, just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place.</seg>
<seg id="21">But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border.</seg>
<seg id="23">So it's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh.</seg>
<seg id="24">True, Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition, at least for this week.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years, and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending China, which still aids the Khmer Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's time the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen's rules.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the U.S. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on Indochina's bleak scene could only disturb America's allies elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="29">It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following: Fight viciously enough and the U.S., under the banner of pragmatism, might eventually help negotiate your way to victory.</seg>
<seg id="30">U.S. diplomacy has done it before, and it will likely do it again.</seg>
<seg id="31">The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia's non-communists.</seg>
<seg id="32">But now the possibility of "diplomatic movement" (Vietnam's withdrawal, the Baker initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the U.S. would then rearm the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why the timidity?</seg>
<seg id="34">At the very least, the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="35">When that day comes, it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Labour is no longer a broad church.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is intolerant of those who speak their minds</seg>
<seg id="3">When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.</seg>
<seg id="5">My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.</seg>
<seg id="6">In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."</seg>
<seg id="9">For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.</seg>
<seg id="11">It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.</seg>
<seg id="12">This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that is not just my experience.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.</seg>
<seg id="20">I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that is not what I came into politics to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.</seg>
<seg id="24">No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.</seg>
<seg id="25">To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.</seg>
<seg id="26">But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."</seg>
<seg id="7">Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.</seg>
<seg id="8">Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.</seg>
<seg id="9">But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.</seg>
<seg id="13">Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.</seg>

<seg id="1">Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism ("Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet," by David Brooks, editorial page, Oct. 5).</seg>
<seg id="2">Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists.</seg>
<seg id="3">It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage- and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="5">Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs, which promulgated medical therapy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy, eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most public-health measures were handled at the local level.</seg>
<seg id="9">New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring." Shortly thereafter, hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened, uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century.</seg>
<seg id="10">These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich, Barry Commoner, Rene Dubois and George Wald.</seg>
<seg id="11">Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years, and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were many more.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic, with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats.</seg>
<seg id="15">Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain, greenhouse warming and ozone depletion, all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation (which, they claim, depletes natural resources) and nuclear power (even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect).</seg>
<seg id="19">They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering.</seg>
<seg id="20">New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power.</seg>
<seg id="21">Let's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore.</seg>

<seg id="24">Your story missed some essential points of the conference on "The Global Environment: Are We Overreacting?"</seg>
<seg id="25">First and foremost, the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Consider, for example, the greenhouse effect and climate change; numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees, including one from the National Academy of Science, judge there is a greater than 50% probability of a grave problem in the offing.</seg>
<seg id="27">The point was to answer the question in the conference title, not to try to create news stories for the event itself.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions, although various points were raised.</seg>
<seg id="29">Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic, not deliver a point of view.</seg>
<seg id="30">Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change.</seg>
<seg id="31">This leads to a very special sense of urgency.</seg>
<seg id="32">If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues, that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism.</seg>
<seg id="33">The environment can no longer be a normal issue, to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change.</seg>
<seg id="34">We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet's atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="35">This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems.</seg>
<seg id="36">The problems of the environment are so interrelated, so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="37">The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">No, we are not overreacting.</seg>

<seg id="1">'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific</seg>
<seg id="2">Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.</seg>
<seg id="3">Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.</seg>
<seg id="4">Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.</seg>
<seg id="5">To recover it is a duty."</seg>
<seg id="6">Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="10">Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.</seg>
<seg id="12">But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.</seg>
<seg id="15">And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.</seg>
<seg id="19">The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.</seg>
<seg id="20">Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."</seg>

<seg id="1">Richard Breeden hadn't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone.</seg>
<seg id="2">It was, after all, only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the lack of lines became painfully apparent.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk, where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves.</seg>
<seg id="5">With other anxious calls pouring in, he recalls, "I'd either have to disconnect the New York Stock Exchange or go out to the secretary's desk."</seg>
<seg id="6">It won't happen again.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now there are more lines connected to the chairman's office, and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's all part of a new "command center."</seg>
<seg id="9">The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. Breeden's stance as the nation's top securities regulator.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like his predecessor, David Ruder, he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office.</seg>
<seg id="11">But unlike Mr. Ruder, who during the 1987 crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed, Mr. Breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage, using it to further his agenda for the SEC.</seg>
<seg id="12">In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market.</seg>
<seg id="13">A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings-and-loan bailout, Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls.</seg>
<seg id="14">More broadly, he wants to "modernize" regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market.</seg>
<seg id="15">He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs, an area the SEC doesn't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="16">Also unlike Mr. Ruder, Mr. Breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a former White House aide who worked closely with Congress, he is savvy in the ways of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">What's more, the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the five-member commission, enabling him to avoid the dissension that frustrated his predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Mr. Breeden, a 39-year-old securities lawyer, has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="20">For instance, he hasn't stated a clear position on high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks.</seg>
<seg id="21">He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules.</seg>
<seg id="22">He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission, a job vacant since the summer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr. Breeden's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the SEC's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street.</seg>
<seg id="24">Congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while.</seg>
<seg id="25">Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Indeed, during Mr. Breeden's confirmation hearing last month, senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job.</seg>
<seg id="27">These days, Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday's harrowing morning session.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence, Mr. Breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not everyone has jumped on the Breeden bandwagon, however.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some in Washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC. "I don't think this was a real test," says one congressional aide. "It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had Richard Breeden there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference."</seg>
<seg id="31">For some at the SEC, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider.</seg>
<seg id="32">They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie.</seg>
<seg id="33">They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the White House.</seg>
<seg id="34">But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the SEC his way.</seg>
<seg id="35">During the Monday market rebound, a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points.</seg>
<seg id="36">Stunned, Mr. Breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer, which by then was next to his desk.</seg>
<seg id="37">It showed the DJIA up 30 points.</seg>
<seg id="38">SEC staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service, Quotron, had miscalculated the industrial average.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr. Breeden instructed SEC staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number. "It was the plunge that didn't happen," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mr. Breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the California earthquake -- to move another rule change past Congress.</seg>
<seg id="41">That disaster closed the Pacific Stock Exchange's stock options-trading operation, forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="42">Though obscure to most investors, the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress, mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them.</seg>
<seg id="43">Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mr. Breeden, not missing a chance to press his agenda, cited the earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="45">That event, he contended, simply shows the "vulnerability" of having listings on only one exchange.</seg>

<seg id="1">We read with interest Robert Tomsho's Sept. 28 page-one article on Robert Redford ("The Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance").</seg>
<seg id="2">Misunderstanding conversations with us, Mr. Tomsho argued that Mr. Redford's environmental views are at odds with Utah residents.</seg>
<seg id="3">This may have been true 10 years ago, but times have changed, even in Utah.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr. Redford no longer stands out as an extremist.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has not changed, but those around him have.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas, rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream, conservative Utahans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recently, some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters and the National Rifle Association joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound Central Utah Project.</seg>
<seg id="8">While Utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism, public views toward the environment have significantly improved.</seg>
<seg id="9">In one of the most conservative, Republican states in the entire nation, the greening of Robert Redford's neighbors is the real story that Mr. Tomsho missed.</seg>

<seg id="12">Gary Bryner</seg>

<seg id="14">If Mr. Redford wanted to be accepted by the people of Utah, he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences.</seg>
<seg id="15">Furthermore, his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power-plant construction, coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment, but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the Wasatch Range into a ski resort.</seg>
<seg id="16">It astounds me he can rationalize his self-righteous and greedy actions in Utah.</seg>

<seg id="23">He's rich, famous and intelligent, and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Redford is slowing down a mindless, speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="25">Personally, I'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit takers, and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future, not caring about the long-range implications.</seg>

<seg id="1">Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman's recent Money Matters article ("Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts" Oct. 3), I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="2">In particular, I do not find the fact that your group of pros' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Dorfman states that an investor who invested $100,000 a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later, purchasing the four new pro picks, and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $166,537, excluding account dividends, taxes and commissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast, an investor holding the Dow Jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $127,446.</seg>
<seg id="5">Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk.</seg>
<seg id="8">I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="12">A four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk.</seg>
<seg id="13">This means the returns can vary a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month.</seg>

<seg id="16">Texas Tech University</seg>
<seg id="17">Lubbock, Texas</seg>
<seg id="18">Your Investment Dartboard article misses the target.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory.</seg>
<seg id="20">What matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, your pickers' recommendations for the coming month are, on average, 22.5% riskier than holding the market portfolio according to Value Line's Beta estimates.</seg>
<seg id="22">James Morgan's pick for October -- Dynascan -- is a substantial 35% riskier than the market portfolio; his lauded Thermo Electron pick is 40% riskier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm, few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease.</seg>
<seg id="2">To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment, however, the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective.</seg>
<seg id="4">Specifically, it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="5">When a regional economy catches cold, the local real-estate market gets pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="6">In other words, real-estate market indicators, such as building permits and leasing activity, plummet much further than a local economy in recession.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the reverse is also true: When a region's economy rebounds from a slowdown, these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles?</seg>
<seg id="10">Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s, as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Area employment dropped by 13% from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14%.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the real-estate market was hurt even more.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76% from the 1979 peak level.</seg>
<seg id="15">Once metropolitan Detroit's economy rallied in the mid-1980s, real estate rebounded.</seg>
<seg id="16">Building permits, for example, soared a staggering 400% between 1982 and the peak year of 1986.</seg>
<seg id="17">Where, savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking, are today's opportunities?</seg>
<seg id="18">Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver, two of the most depressed, overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play.</seg>
<seg id="20">But now appears to be the time to act.</seg>
<seg id="21">Metropolitan Houston's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the mid-1980s, employment was down as much as 5% from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13%.</seg>
<seg id="23">The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="24">Office construction dropped 97%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The vacancy rate soared more than 20% in nearly every product category, and more than 30% of office space was vacant.</seg>
<seg id="26">To some observers, the empty office buildings of Houston's "see-through skyline" were indicative of a very troubled economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">As usual, the real-estate market had overreacted.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually, the region's economy retained a firm foundation.</seg>
<seg id="29">Metropolitan Houston's population has held steady over the past six years.</seg>
<seg id="30">And personal income, after slumping in the mid-1980s, has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms.</seg>
<seg id="31">Today, metropolitan Houston's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="32">More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year, primarily in biotechnology, petrochemical processing, and the computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="33">This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">And forecasts project a 2.5% to 3% growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average.</seg>
<seg id="35">Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region's economic trends, although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston.</seg>
<seg id="36">By some measures, metropolitan Denver's economy has actually improved in the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its population has continued to increase since 1983, the peak year of the economic cycle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Employment is now 4% higher than in 1983.</seg>
<seg id="39">Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15% between 1983 and 1987 (the most recent year available).</seg>
<seg id="40">The rates of increase, however, are less than the rapid growth of the boom years, and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="41">In a self-fulfilling prophecy, therefore, the region's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="42">Housing building permits are down more than 75% from their 1983 peaks.</seg>
<seg id="43">Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver's real-estate market will rebound, major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center, a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area, and a new regional airport.</seg>
<seg id="44">When Denver's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return, and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound.</seg>
<seg id="45">What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston's or Denver's?</seg>
<seg id="46">Generally, overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak, even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington, New York and Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Vacancy rates in the 15% to 19% range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20% range in a couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="48">Under these conditions, even a flattening out of economic growth -- "catching cold" -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia.</seg>
<seg id="49">Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term (three-year) lease and wait for the bargains ahead.</seg>

<seg id="1">Procurement of public building and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint report on parallel audit submitted by the Czech Supreme Audit Ofice (NKÚ) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH)</seg>
<seg id="3">Introduction and overview</seg>
<seg id="4">The procurement of goods and services by public-sector contracting agencies is of great importance both for the government and for the business community.</seg>
<seg id="5">The government’s task is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the European Union (EU), public contract awarding is key to the success of the single economic area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In order to ensure a largely unrestricted competition in the field of crossborder procurement, awarding authorities also have to meet certain requirements imposed by the EU in awarding contracts where the contract value exceeds certain thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="8">To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose EU procurement law into their national law and apply it.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has already happened both in the Czech Republic and in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">For contracts worth less than the EU thresholds, regulating public contract awarding procedures remains a matter for the individual countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, the contract award procedure is, as a rule, vulnerable to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="12">In view of the generally high damage potential, awarding authorities are obliged to take reasonable action to fight and to rule out corruption and abusive favouritism in their contract award procedures (corruption prevention).</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – NKÚ) and the Bundesrechnungshof of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits both of the EU-wide awarding of building contracts and of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="14">The audit focused on the application of EU procurement law as transposed into national law and corruption prevention of contracts for building construction and road construction and/or transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">The audit also covered contract awards below the EU thresholds with a view to corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="16">The two SAIs’ audit findings are summarised in the joint report, which is also to be addressed to international institutions such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).</seg>
<seg id="17">Fields of audit and audited bodies</seg>
<seg id="18">The assessments performed by the German SAI are for the most part based on horizontal audits of the above-mentioned topics, which we carried out at German building authorities responsible for federal road and building construction in the years 2011–2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">This included e.g. the construction of motorways and large building construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to that, the German SAI included findings from previous audits in the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="21">The assessments performed by the Czech SAI were based on audit findings generated in the years 2008–2012. The audits covered the construction of roads, railway lines, hydraulic engineering projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural buildings, universities, etc.), and some other areas in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">Federal contract award procedures in Germany are largely conducted by the construction administrations of the countries.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the Czech Republic, the road and estimate construction administrations of the State have central responsibilities for awarding contracts relating to transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="24">In building construction, responsibility for contract award procedures is decentralised, i.e. the procedures are conducted by the entities which receive state budget funds.</seg>
<seg id="25">In both countries, the services of self-employed professionals are used in individual stages of contract award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="26">When comparing the assessments, differences in procurement legislation and structural peculiarities of the construction services and markets of both countries have to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Structure of procurement law in the two countries</seg>
<seg id="28">In Germany, the conduct of EU-wide contract award procedures is governed by Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation.</seg>
<seg id="29">Contract award procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and administrative regulations based on it .</seg>
<seg id="30">Many supplementary provisions both for EU-wide and national contract awards are contained in internal administrative rules.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further details concerning the requirements of EU procurement law and corruption prevention are set forth in the socalled “contract award manuals” of the Federal Government, in which the requirements are complemented or formulated in greater detail taking regard to judicial precedent in the field of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Czech Republic, contract award procedure is governed exclusively by the respective Act on Public Procurement and other legal provisions, which apply to contract values both above and below the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="33">Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="34">The new provisions strengthened transparency in the management of public funds, opened the way for more competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the contract award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Basic features of procurement law in the two countries</seg>
<seg id="36">In both countries, especially the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be applied where contracts are to be awarded EU-wide.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Germany, contracts below the EU threshold are awarded in accordance with the national procedures (public invitation to tender, restricted invitation to tender, negotiated contract), which, however, are aforementioned procedures. largely identical with the EU-wide contract award.</seg>
<seg id="38">Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for the open procedure (where tenders have to be invited EU-wide) and for the public invitation to tender (in case of merely national contract awards).</seg>
<seg id="39">Under the open procedure and the public invitation to tender, every interested enterprise may submit a bid.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</seg>
<seg id="41">This is achieved mainly by dividing an overall public works project in trade-specific lots and part lots.</seg>
<seg id="42">By awarding separate contracts for these lots, as many enterprises as possible, are to be given the chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="43">The two aforementioned characteristics of German procurement are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="44">More than 330,000 construction firms with workforce of 1.9 mil. are registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide contract award procedures are also to be applied to public works contracts below the EU threshold.</seg>
<seg id="46">An exception to this is the simplified procedure below threshold, where the contracting authorities may under certain conditions use considerably less strict procedure.</seg>
<seg id="47">In agreement with EU law, Czech procurement law includes provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded, if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is obtained.</seg>
<seg id="48">The present Czech legislation enables contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Czech Republic, there are about 85,000 registered building companies, out of it 1,900 building contractors with 20 or more workers each.</seg>
<seg id="50">Aggregate volume of public works contracts awarded by contracting agencies and shares of contract award types in the two countries</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany totalled € 307 billion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of these, € 45.5 billion (equivalent to 15 per cent) were accounted for by public contracts which, apart from contracts awarded by the Federal Government, included contracts awarded by the Federal States and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">The total volume of federal building and road construction projects (without railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to € 8.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="54">In 2011, the breakdown of federal contracts for building construction and construction of longdistance roads by type of award procedure was as follows:</seg>
<seg id="55">80.7 % Open procedures and public invitations to tender 12.7 % Restricted procedures and restricted invitations to tender 6.6 % Negotiated procedures and discretionary awarding of contracts 33.2 % of which were EU-wide tenders.</seg>
<seg id="56">In 2011, the volume of public works in the Czech Republic totalled € 4.7 billion, which accounts for about 25 per cent of the total volume of all building works in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2009 the volume reached € 7.8 billion e.g. 37% of the total volume of public works.</seg>
<seg id="58">Structure of types of awards in 2011: 65,1 % open procedure 14,3 % restricted procedure 9,5 % negotiated procedure 8,4 % simplified procedure for awards below the threshold 2.7 % other procedures</seg>
<seg id="59">The data comprise all public contracts for supplies, services and construction works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="60">These figures show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public contract awarding; corruption prevention, that always has to be observed when awarding contracts, has a significant financial impact and the open procedure and/or open tendering are of key importance when awarding contracts.</seg>
<seg id="61">Summary of the basic results</seg>
<seg id="62">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Supreme Audit Institution of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits of EU-wide awarding of public works contracts and corruption prevention in their respective countries.</seg>
<seg id="63">In this context, the working groups of the two SAIs compared the legal frameworks and administrative regulations in the Czech Republic and in Germany and the results of their parallel audits which they conducted specifically in the fields of building construction and road construction.</seg>
<seg id="64">The key findings were:</seg>
<seg id="65">The EU Directives on the awarding of public works contracts have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (items 1 and 3.1).</seg>
<seg id="66">Corruption prevention is not only the purpose of the EU Directives but also of the national procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ as to their points of emphasis and degree of detail.</seg>
<seg id="67">In both countries, an essential requirement to be met by the tender documents is that they have to include all information needed for appropriately drawing up bids.</seg>
<seg id="68">The specifications must be neutral and not include any requirements that restrict competition.</seg>
<seg id="69">The tender documents in Germany largely complied with these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Czech Republic the problem of determining the subject of the contract largely exists.</seg>
<seg id="71">In Germany, public works are to be divided into lots whenever possible in order to promote competition.</seg>
<seg id="72">According to the BRH’s findings, this requirement was largely met in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="73">The NKÚ’s audits showed that awarding large volumes of public road works without division into lots or division in only very large lots may impair competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.</seg>
<seg id="74">These restrictions of market potential may result in major cost increases and bear the risk of undue price negotiations and collusion.</seg>
<seg id="75">Legal provisions of both countries enable, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities to award contracts of additional or modified construction works if the need for this arises after concluding the contract (item 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="76">The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely complied with in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="77">According to the provisions of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities may freely choose between open and restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="78">In contrast, the relevant German provisions in procurement and budgetary law stipulate the precedence of the open procedure both for EU-wide tenders and for national tenders known as public invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="79">This enables more enterprise to submit bids.</seg>
<seg id="80">This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing by collusion of bidders difficult and produces the best results in terms of value for money.</seg>
<seg id="81">In the case of major work projects whose estimated total value reached or exceeded a threshold set by the EU, the contracting authorities audited always applied Europe-wide tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="82">When determining the type of award procedure, the correct estimation of the contract value is of essential importance.</seg>
<seg id="83">In Germany, databases for objective setting estimated public works prices are used, especially in the area of building construction.</seg>
<seg id="84">The data is based on evaluations of construction projects already completed.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Czech Republic, the databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not efficient tool as yet (item 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="86">Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, prior information and contract notices have to be published. This is to strengthen competition by allowing interested enterprises to prepare at an early stage for submitting bids.</seg>
<seg id="87">Kontrolovaní zadavatelé zpravidla tento požadavek plnili.</seg>
<seg id="88">V ojedinělých případech byly zjištěny omyly ve zveřejněných informacích, nesprávná aplikace požadavků a nedostatek kontrol, což mohlo konkurenci poškodit (bod 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="89">The selection of bidders for participation in restricted award procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Under EU law, the number of bidders invited must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="91">The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries are to alternate as frequently as possible among the enterprises to be invited when selecting participants.</seg>
<seg id="93">In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to counteract the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="94">In some cases, the audited bodies did not take regard to the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Czech Republic, the selection decisions made were not always plausible (item 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="96">In both countries, the contracting authorities have to ensure, during the tender stage, that all enterprises interested in submitting a tender receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="97">To avoid collusion that would restrict competition, any contacts among these enterprises and between them and independent professionals that were involved in drawing up the specifications have to be prevented to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="98">The corresponding provisions in Germany are more extensive than those in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="99">However, the audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with requirements in some cases (item 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="100">In both countries, the opening of the bids must comply with the cross-check and transparency principles.</seg>
<seg id="101">The requirements for the marking, documentation, preservation and secrecy of the bids are to restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audits in both countries revealed only few deficiencies (item 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="103">Examination and evaluation of the bids are regulated in both countries by requirements for structural organisation and procedures.</seg>
<seg id="104">The respective German rules are more comprehensive but were not always, complied with by the audited contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="105">For instance, contracting authorities passed bids on to third parties for examination without first inspecting them and without adequately documenting any conspicuous feature.</seg>
<seg id="106">The bids were thus inadequately protected against subsequent manipulations (item 4.7).</seg>
<seg id="107">On completion of EU-wide contract award procedures, the participating předem informováni. Důvodem je dát účastníkům řízení možnost nechat přezkoumat rozhodnutí o udělení zakázky.</seg>
<seg id="108">Toto pravidlo právní ochrany je rovněž určeno k zabránění korupčních aktivit.</seg>
<seg id="109">Česká právní úprava řeší otázku právního přezkoumání zadávacího řízení i u národních řízení.</seg>
<seg id="110">Pouze v ojedinělých případech nebylo plnění informačních povinností náležitě zabezpečeno. (bod 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="111">The documentation of the contract award procedures by the audited construction authorities in the two countries was not always complete or plausible.</seg>
<seg id="112">In the case of some procedures, the transparency requirement, which applies throughout the EU, had not been adequately observed in the contract award memos.</seg>
<seg id="113">Moreover, some of the deficiencies found diminished the corruption prevention effect of the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="114">The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting duties (item 4.9).</seg>
<seg id="115">Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="116">European procurement law</seg>
<seg id="117">In order to guarantee free competition and free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts) and the Directive on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (Remedies Directive), that were to be transposed into national law.</seg>
<seg id="118">In particular, the general procurement principles of the European Union include the competition requirement, the equal treatment requirement or prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="119">To accomplish these objectives, the Directive on the coordination of EU-wide procedures for the award of contracts includes provisions relative to construction projects the expected order total of which reaches or exceeds € 5 million.</seg>
<seg id="120">Such provisions impact especially on the contents of tender documents, the applicable type of procedure, the publication of certain information prior to, during and after the contract award procedure, the compliance with the deadlines for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the contract award dokumentaci celého zadávacího řízení; the qualification requirements that may be imposed on tenderers and the criteria according to which a tender is selected.</seg>
<seg id="121">The tenderers’ legal protection is governed by the Remedies Directive.</seg>
<seg id="122">In the case of potential breaches of procurement law, enterprises may have the contracting authority’s decision reviewed within review procedures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="124">Corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="125">Significance of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="126">In neither country is there a legal definition of what constitutes corruption.</seg>
<seg id="127">In general, corruption is understood to mean the misuse of a position of confidence for private advantage.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a rule, it is implied that such abuse is incited by those who benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="129">Corruption may hamper competition and may cause substantial economic damage.</seg>
<seg id="130">According to estimates, global costs caused by corruption, amount to 5 % of the global economic output.</seg>
<seg id="131">For the European Union area, these costs are estimated at an amount equivalent of 1 % of the area’s economic output.</seg>
<seg id="132">If the contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or unfair behaviour may undermine confidence in the integrity and the capability of the public administration to function.</seg>
<seg id="133">Thus, preventing corruption is an essential task for awarding authorities.</seg>
<seg id="134">Practices and procedures are to be reviewed to adress areas that are especially vulnerable to corruption so that appropriate anticorruption measures can be taken.</seg>
<seg id="135">Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls may substantially reduce vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="136">As a rule, the awarding of works contracts is considered to be particularly vulnerable to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="137">Measures to prevent corruption</seg>
<seg id="138">In Germany, corruption is prosecuted under penal and employment law, this especially applies to active and passive bribery and to the undue acceptance of benefits and undue granting of benefits.</seg>
<seg id="139">In order to prevent corruption, the German Federal Government issued a guideline together with recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration , according to which, in addition to risk analyses, the following principles shall apply to contract award procedures: precedence of open tendering multiple control principle and transparent decision-making separation of planning, awarding of contracts and accounting precise and full documentation of procurement procedures.</seg>
<seg id="140">In addition, further provisions having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="141">In 2011, the federal department responsible introduced an IT-supported system to monitor the awarding of federal road construction contracts.</seg>
<seg id="142">By means of this system, procurement data, e.g. estimated costs, order total and private independent professionals involved, can be fully recorded and analysed with a view to finding irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the Czech Republic, corruption is similiarly prosecuted under penal and employment law.</seg>
<seg id="144">The legal requirements of transparency, equal treatment of bidders and prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="145">Anti-corruption measures in the area of public procurement have been set down by the government in a strategy on fight against corruption for 2011–2012 which was updated for 2013–2014.</seg>
<seg id="146">Some parts of these measures were already incorporated into public procurement law and respective implementing regulations.</seg>
<seg id="147">The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions decrease of contracts for small scale obligation of prior contract award announcement by the contracting authority, including the reasons of the contract prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus impossibility of limiting the number of tenderers based on drawing obligation of publishing the contract awarded, including the supplements obligation of publishing the real price and the list of sub-contractors</seg>
<seg id="148">Audit results related to the successive phases of the contract award procedure</seg>
<seg id="149">Tender documents</seg>
<seg id="150">Tender documents The tender documents must include all information which the bidders need for preparing their tenders in due form.</seg>
<seg id="151">In particular, the tender documents must permit accurate costing.</seg>
<seg id="152">To ensure this, bidders must not be burdened with risks they cannot calculate.</seg>
<seg id="153">The tender documents mainly consist of the specifications. They also include the requirements for proving the bidders’ qualification and the criteria for selecting the most cost-effective bid.</seg>
<seg id="154">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="155">Requirements provided for by EU law especially focus on technical specifications.</seg>
<seg id="156">All bidders must have equal access to them and they are to restrict competition as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="157">As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral.</seg>
<seg id="158">Any details as to specific products or manufacturers as part of the technical specifications are therefore admissible only within narrow limits.</seg>
<seg id="159">To avoid the inclusion in the tender documents of requirements that restrict competition is an elementary principle of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="160">Furthermore, it is necessary to avoid ambiguities or inaccurate information when preparing the tender documents, since such deficiencies provide a scope for speculations in connection with the preparation of bids and for manipulations in the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="161">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="162">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="163">Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions about technical specifications into their national law.</seg>
<seg id="164">As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral without requiring any particular brands.</seg>
<seg id="165">As a matter of principle, the specifications must outline the supplies and services required, detailing the number of units of work or supplies.</seg>
<seg id="166">In this normal case, prices are to be stipulated by units of work or supplies (e.g. euro/m² or euro/item).</seg>
<seg id="167">Only in exceptional cases is it admissible to define the work to be done in terms of functional objectives.</seg>
<seg id="168">As a rule the specifications need to be complete and unambiguous.</seg>
<seg id="169">They have to include precise quantities and may not comprise work or supplies whose necessity is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="170">Remuneration in lump sum form or input of working time should be avoided whenever possible.</seg>
<seg id="171">These provisions are to preclude speculations and manipulations based on ambiguous specifications in the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="172">The specifications must enable each bidder to prepare his bid safely and without extensive preliminary work.</seg>
<seg id="173">The invitation to tender is to be announced only after completion of the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="174">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="175">In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to invite construction tenderers for lots.</seg>
<seg id="176">The contracting authority is entitled to subdivide a public contract into several separate lots, if it is admitted by the nature of the subject-matter of such public contract.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Germany, there is a requirement in principle to divide construction projects into lots, either divided by quantities (partial lots) and/or specialties (specialised lots).</seg>
<seg id="178">This is to enable small and medium-sized contractors to compete, to increase the number of potential bidders and to make price-fixing more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="179">This type of award is considered as usually providing best value for money.</seg>
<seg id="180">In the Czech Republic, all tender documents, both for national and EU-wide awards, must include the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="181">This is to inform the bidder completely and exhaustively about the criteria according to which his tender is to be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="182">In Germany, the requirement to indicate evaluation criteria in the EU-wide contract notice or, failing that, in the tender documents applies only to EU-wide invitations to tender.</seg>
<seg id="183">In national contract award procedures, the evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract award memo, which is an internal administrative document.</seg>
<seg id="184">Where the tender documents are prepared by commissioned independent professionals, the German regulations require any information to be omitted from the tender documents that may help to identify the (firms of) architects or civil engineers involved.</seg>
<seg id="185">This is to prevent individual contractors from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent professionals without the contracting authority being aware of this.</seg>
<seg id="186">This is also the reason why independent professionals may neither post tender documents nor make planning documents available for inspection.</seg>
<seg id="187">The contracting authority is the sole contact of the contractors.</seg>
<seg id="188">At present, no similar provision is in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="189">In case of big construction projects, the necessity of extra or modified works almost always occurs after conclusion of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="190">Legislation in both countries enables to award the extra works contract up to a certain threshold to the same supplier without having to conduct an award procedure and to publish a contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="191">The volume of extra works as per both European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of original contract price.</seg>
<seg id="192">In addition, extra works need to be indispensable and identifiable as extra components to the major contract.</seg>
<seg id="193">In the Czech Republic, stricter limit of 20% applies to such award procedure without publishing a contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="194">However, this may bring higher risks of time delays of project realization and eventual involvement of a new constructor in the project just underway.</seg>
<seg id="195">If the extra works contract is also awarded to the supplier already contracted, German law stipulates the rules not enabling contractors to arbitrarily increase the prices of such modified and/or extra works.</seg>
<seg id="196">Such calculations must be done with reference to the agreed prices of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="197">Apart of extra works, less works in construction may occur.</seg>
<seg id="198">In Czech republic, less works cannot be mixed with additional extra works.</seg>
<seg id="199">Basic audit findings</seg>
<seg id="200">BHR</seg>
<seg id="201">Technical specifications and productneutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="202">In individual cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards that had in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.</seg>
<seg id="203">In some cases, specifications also contained data requiring certain brands for example for graffiti resistance systems, water stops or noise abatement tiles –, although this was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="204">In some cases specifications were so detailed that only one product could fulfil the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="205">Bills of quantities subdivided into items</seg>
<seg id="206">In none of the procedures audited did the German SAI detect any cases of non-compliance with the general requirement to invite tenders for supplies and services according to bills of quantities subdivided into items.</seg>
<seg id="207">Comprehensiveness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="208">In most of the cases reviewed, the tender documents had been fully elaborated before the process of soliciting bids was launched.</seg>
<seg id="209">However in various cases, documents had to be modified during the tendering process to pay due regard to changing items or time schedules.</seg>
<seg id="210">In isolated cases, tender documents contained work or supplies whose necessity was uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="211">One tender document on demolition work we looked at consisted almost exclusively of such items.</seg>
<seg id="212">Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded</seg>
<seg id="213">In a large number of cases, the required justification for not subdividing the lots of services into partial lots was not given.</seg>
<seg id="214">The criteria we studied according to which the contract is to be awarded gave us no reason to point out shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="215">Inclusion of names of self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="216">In a number of documents the commissioned independent professionals involved were mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="217">The names were identified on the cover sheets or on the plans or opinions attached.</seg>
<seg id="218">In one case, the contracting authority even called upon bidders to contact the architect explicitly mentioned regarding questions on the tender.</seg>
<seg id="219">In building construction projects such cases were caused in the first place by the self-employed persons commissioned to develop the specification documents.</seg>
<seg id="220">The building administration services stated that they did not have enough staff to control the tender documents in detail.</seg>
<seg id="221">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="222">Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender</seg>
<seg id="223">In case of public procurement for 12 apartments building, there was reference to concrete supplier and type of product mentioned in the specification.</seg>
<seg id="224">Contracting authority did not admit using of other comparable types of products. and did not give reason for insisting on these concrete suppliers and products.</seg>
<seg id="225">In connections with the constructing of various university facilities, the tender documents specified concrete suppliers and products.</seg>
<seg id="226">Overall list of specifications with partial specifications</seg>
<seg id="227">In case of constructions of some industrial zones contracting authority did not clearly specify the volume and type of requested works and supplies in the list of measurement, and as measuring unit he specified for each building only the built up volume in cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="228">Comprehensiveness of specifications</seg>
<seg id="229">During the procurement of public contract for construction of a road circle, the tender documentation for restricted procedure was four times changed in the period of August– September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="230">The reason was increasing of scope of delivery and changes of technical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="231">In case of some social buildings construction the tender documentation showed mistakes which resulted in necessity of extra works (precise location missing, technical and constructional research insufficient, drawings missing).</seg>
<seg id="232">Tender documentation for construction of a big library described the elements of interior only without specifying product quality requirements.</seg>
<seg id="233">As a result, some sub suppliers provided some very expensive and above standard equipment.</seg>
<seg id="234">Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded</seg>
<seg id="235">In the Czech Republic, no obligation of dividing public works projects into partial lots or awarding partial contracts is in place.</seg>
<seg id="236">Analysis of three big parts of a road circle construction proved that within their public procurement in parts (individually by selected installations), savings amounting up to 31.6 million EUR could have been achieved, out of total of achieved public contract prices amounting to 620.3 million EUR.</seg>
<seg id="237">For example, in case of offer price for 6 individual construction objects as 6 separate parts of one public contract, the savings of 2.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the construction works of 20 bridges had been awarded as a separate part of one public contract, the savings amounting to 11.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="239">In case of road constructions, contracting authority imposed very extensive requirements for references as suitability criteria.</seg>
<seg id="240">In tender documentation of open procedure for one part of a motorway construction, contracting authority requested, among others, such experience of a supplier, proving his realization of at least three road construction projects worth 28 million EUR each, finalized or put into operation within the last 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="241">In the Czech Republic, there are not more than 9 suppliers complying with the above prerequisite.</seg>
<seg id="242">Open public procurement for another part of a motorway construction included 6 separate construction works, where the contracting authority demanded minimum yearly construction volume of construction works worth € 480 million within the last 3 years.</seg>
<seg id="243">Podle provedeného rozboru získalo dvě třetiny finančního objemu zakázek v oblasti pozemních komunikací (62,5 mld. Kč z 92,5 mld. Kč) v letech 2008 až 2009 pět firem buď samostatně, nebo v rámci sdružení.</seg>
<seg id="244">In case of together 46 contract award procedures worth € 528 million, there were just two or even one only tenderer.</seg>
<seg id="245">NKÚ pointed out that restriction of the market potentional may result in major cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="246">Area of extra works</seg>
<seg id="247">In case of a road circle construction, contracting authority did not conclude written contract for delivery of extra works (in two cases) and he did not contracted those extra works according to any of procedures prescribed by law.</seg>
<seg id="248">Value of extra works amounted in the first case up to € 6.7 million without VAT (increase by 21%), in second case up to € 165.4 million without VAT (increase by 91%).</seg>
<seg id="249">The reason was an unclear determination of quantity a quality features of works.</seg>
<seg id="250">In case of various University facilities the contracting authority did not comprise some works and deliveries into the tender documentation even if their need and necessity for construction completion and for final inspection were known just when the contract had been awarded. These works and deliveries were done on basis of addendums to the contract between contracting authority and supplier in negotiation procedure without publication.</seg>
<seg id="251">The volume of extra works overpassed the national limit 20% of the original contract.</seg>
<seg id="252">In connection with the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award contracts for additional work without invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="253">During construction, the contracting authority increased the contract volume by € 2 million.</seg>
<seg id="254">The unit prices for the additional work commissioned without competition were considirably higher than comparable work done by the same contractor.</seg>
<seg id="255">Other findings</seg>
<seg id="256">Based on selected sample of constructions, NKÚ found out that the average costs of construction of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic amounts up to € 14.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="257">According to the long term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction of Germany, the average costs of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in Germany amount up to € 10.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="258">This comparison suggests, that construction of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly compared to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="259">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="260">The basic legal provisions about tender documents are largely identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of EU law.</seg>
<seg id="261">Their purpose is both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.</seg>
<seg id="262">The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable bidders to accurately calculate the costs and prepare their tenders.</seg>
<seg id="263">Moreover, this requirement is to limit the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is to be protected against the need to make contracts for extra work later.</seg>
<seg id="264">In Germany, the basic legal provisions about tender documents are supplemented by additional regulations that are to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for effecting manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="265">While no similarly detailed requirements of this kind exist in the Czech Republic, higher transparency is achieved there by the publication of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="266">The requirements for specifications have largely been complied with in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="267">In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have resulted in restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="268">The rule in force in Germany that requires the segmentation of large work projects into lots promotes competition and cost-effective results.</seg>
<seg id="269">The NKÚ has found that, in the Czech Republic, the award of large works contracts without segmentation into lots or segmentation into very large lots may restrict the circle of bidders to a small number of large enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="270">As a result of the very extensive requirements for reference imposed in the Czech Republic for selecting bidders for road works, public contracts are awarded to only a small circle of bidders and small and medium-sized enterprises are not given the chance to compete.</seg>
<seg id="271">A limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price-fixing and other forms of collusion.</seg>
<seg id="272">Concerning the award of contracts for extra or modified works and the remuneration for such work, the regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="273">According to both European and German legislation, extra works not exceeding 50% of the original contract price can be awarded without tendering procedure and contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="274">In the Czech Republic stricter limit of 20% applies.</seg>
<seg id="275">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="276">This limit is often overstepped by contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="277">The reason is an insufficient definition of public works.</seg>
<seg id="278">If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the extra works must be awarded on the basis of a tendering procedure with contract notice.</seg>
<seg id="279">By dividing work into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting detrimental consequences can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="280">Determining the type of award and taking regard to the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="281">By determining the type of award, the contracting authority defines the number of potential contractors participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="282">The contracting authority may leave the number of potential contractors and bidders largely unrestricted or may restrict the number by opting for a restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of work projects whose value reaches or exceeds a threshold set by the EU, EU-wide tendering procedures must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="284">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="285">When determining the type of award, the contracting authority especially has to comply with the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the estimated total contract value of the construction work to be performed reaches or exceeds the current EU threshold of €5 million, it is always required that the contract be awarded EU-wide by open or restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="287">In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competitive dialogue is admissible.</seg>
<seg id="288">Where construction projects reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a restricted extent from the principle of EU-wide contract awarding and may award contracts by national procedure, if the estimated contract value of the lot concerned is below € 1 million and the total value of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value.</seg>
<seg id="289">It is not allowed to inappropriately divide a project by its nature single construction project without compelling reasons or deliberately estimate its cost too low in order to avoid the obligation in principle to carry out a EU-wide procedure for awarding the works contract.</seg>
<seg id="290">Since restrictions of competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of major importance for purposes of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="291">The detailed justification of the choice of type of award and the considerations made about the obligation to apply EU procurement law are important parts of the documentation of the contract-award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="292">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="293">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="294">Both countries have completely implemented in national law the EU legal requirements for contract award procedures and thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="295">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="296">The Czech Republic has made arrangements to apply the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures laid down in the directive to its national awards of work contracts.</seg>
<seg id="297">Open and restricted procedures may always be freely chosen without the need to document or justify the decision. Other types of procedure are only permitted where certain legally defined conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="298">Differing from that arrangement, the relevant German provisions of budgetary law and of the guidelines for preventing corruption as a rule give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="299">Other types of procedure – including even restricted procedure or restricted tendering – are permitted only in exceptional cases, which are exhaustively determined by procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="300">Such an exceptional case must be plausibly justified and documented.</seg>
<seg id="301">The principle of preference for open procedure or public invitation to tender is to guarantee competition that is as little restricted as possible and to prevent opportunities for manipulation and for price-fixing among bidders by deciding in advance to choose certain tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="302">In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="303">The correct estimation of expected prices of a public contract is an essential basis for deciding the adequate type of public contract award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="304">When estimating the costs of public building construction projects, the construction administrations in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.</seg>
<seg id="305">These databases have been compiled through analyses of completed construction projects. These databases include, among other information, standard cost figures for types of buildings, building units, building components or individual building work.</seg>
<seg id="306">Based on such standard cost figures, it is eventually possible to estimate the contract value of a planned project or building work to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="307">Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have similar databases for road construction.</seg>
<seg id="308">However, it is intended to implement such databases nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="309">Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable construction projects for determining the expected costs of a public contract for building constructions.</seg>
<seg id="310">In most cases, cost determinations are based on estimates of the entity that funds the project or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction administration entity in question.</seg>
<seg id="311">The measures for standardizing are in initial stage only.</seg>
<seg id="312">On the basis of the programme of corruption fighting for the period of 2011–2012, the respective ministries work out the data base of customary prices of standardized commodities.</seg>
<seg id="313">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="314">The data base should serve as set of information about construction and assembling works, materials and products, and other data to enable the calculation of necessary costs and determination of unit prices.</seg>
<seg id="315">Ministry of Transport issued price data base for transport constructions as means of price controlling, which are currently updated.</seg>
<seg id="316">The database is intended to determine the price in project (investment) plan, and they should play comparative function within further phases of construction preparatory works.</seg>
<seg id="317">Key audit findings BRH</seg>
<seg id="318">Choice of tendering procedure</seg>
<seg id="319">The contracting authorities audited largely invited tenders under open procedure or public invitation to tender, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="320">In 2011, 59.5% of the aggregate contract volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was accounted for by public tendering.</seg>
<seg id="321">In road construction, this share was 94.8%.</seg>
<seg id="322">In some case where non-public tendering was chosen, we found that the reasons for the contracting authorities’ infringement of the principle of open procedure or public invitation to tender were not stated in detail.</seg>
<seg id="323">In the course of a horizontal audit, the BRH found, on the basis of information compiled about more than 16,000 contract award procedures, that the restricted procedures have a clear disadvantage, where competition is concerned, in comparison to public procedures and public invitations to tender and that they also increase the risks of manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="324">Public tenders in the field of building construction elicited more than twice as many bids as restricted tenders and nearly three times as many bids as awards under negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="325">Our study also revealed that the bid prices quoted in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were 6% and 10% higher respectively than those quoted in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="326">Parallel studies of the Federal Building Ministry and of a Land court of audit confirmed the differences in value for money obtained by public and by restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="327">The Federal Building Ministry’s performance study even revealed that the prices quoted in restricted procedures were twice as high as those quoted in public procedures.</seg>
<seg id="328">Taking regard to the EU threshold</seg>
<seg id="329">In respect of those work projects whose aggregate contract value was estimated at more than € 5 million, the construction authorities audited usually made contract awarding plans in which they specified which works were to be awarded by EU-wide tender and which by national tender.</seg>
<seg id="330">According to the contract awarding plans, the share of those works that required Europe-wide tendering always exceeded 80% of the total works.</seg>
<seg id="331">There was no evidence of circumvention of the requirement to invite tenders Europe-wide by excessively low cost estimates.</seg>
<seg id="332">However,in some cases, as a result of errors in the calculation of total contract value, the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.</seg>
<seg id="333">During the execution of work, some construction authorities illicitly changed the determinations made in the contract awarding plan.</seg>
<seg id="334">They did not give any reasons for these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering continued to be complied with.</seg>
<seg id="335">The share of EU-wide tendering according to the accounts for the projects was usually lower than laid down in the contract awarding plan.</seg>
<seg id="336">Where the expected contract values of construction projects exceeded the EU threshold, the construction authorities did not apply EU-wide tendering to all individual lots worth more than €1 million.</seg>
<seg id="337">Instead, they awarded the respective contracts under national procedures without giving sound reasons for the necessity of deviating from the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="338">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="339">Choice of tendering procedure</seg>
<seg id="340">In the case of several large-scale building projects, e.g. the construction of some motorway sections, of facilities for a big sports event and of housing projects, the contracting authorities split one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.</seg>
<seg id="341">Splitting resulted in decrease of expected value under the fixed limit, and the contracts were thereafter awarded in less strict under limit procedure, or even out of law regime.</seg>
<seg id="342">Methods for calculating the estimated contract value</seg>
<seg id="343">Price databases set up for transport infrastructure works did not appear as sufficient tool for estimating contract volumes with some degree of accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="344">They originated from just realized public procurements, which comprised eventual lacks of economy, construction over-works or excessive profit of suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="345">The actual prices for three sections of the road circle were about 37% below the determined price from the database.</seg>
<seg id="346">Ministry of transport updated the databases in a way to reflect not only the bid prices of the past years, but even comparison with comparable markets and index numbers of price progress in the area of construction.</seg>
<seg id="347">As far as the building construction concerns, the estimative price was based on budget of project architects or estimation of investors.</seg>
<seg id="348">The true price than varies considerably.</seg>
<seg id="349">Assumed price of a big library reconstruction was doubled compared to the contract price, however, based on eight addendums, in process of realization the final price increased by € 2.1 million, i.e. by 27%.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similarly, when constructing a library despository, the true price was by 33% lower compared to assumed price and prices increased during realization.</seg>
<seg id="351">In other cases, the price of successful bidder is higher compared to assumed price and moreover, during realization it still increases.</seg>
<seg id="352">In case of a big library construction the assumed price increased by € 16 million, i.e. by 22%, and in case of construction of a justice palace, the volume of financial needs increased during the works disproportionately (by 139%) compared to increase of function surfaces (12%).</seg>
<seg id="353">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="354">Since both countries have implemented in national law the EU provisions about the choice of type of awarding procedure and about taking regard to the EU threshold, the respective national provisions are largely identical.</seg>
<seg id="355">However, the principle of public procedure or public tendering applicable in Germany is stricter than the EU provisions and the national provisions in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="356">Compared to the restricted contract-award procedures, public procedure or public tendering gives more businesses the opportunity to participate in competition.</seg>
<seg id="357">These types of contract award procedure generate a large number of bids and the best results in terms of value of money.</seg>
<seg id="358">Corruption prevention is enhanced considerably, since the circle of candidates is not restricted by decisions taken beforehand by the contracting authority which leave room for manipulation and for price fixing among bidders.</seg>
<seg id="359">The studies have confirmed the advantage obtained through the German rule that preference must be given to public procedure or public invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="360">Czech legal rules enable the contracting authorities to award a contract in open or restricted procedure.</seg>
<seg id="361">However, the latest amendment of procurement law has introduced a general prohibition to limit the number of bidders in procedures that involve a prior competition for participation.</seg>
<seg id="362">The restricted procedure has now become very similar to the open procedure.</seg>
<seg id="363">In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirement to give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender, whereas in the Czech Republic some projects have been divided, which is not allowed, in order to circumvent the requirements governing the choice of the type of awarding procedure.</seg>
<seg id="364">However, in Germany in some cases the EU threshold has not been taken regard to, ensuing that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.</seg>
<seg id="365">In the Czech Republic, no satisfactory solution facilitating the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and construction projects does yet exist.</seg>
<seg id="366">The construction authorities should ensure, if applicable, by means of more extensive controls that the requirements governing the choice of type of awarding procedure and the volume of contracts to be awarded EU-wide are complied with or should create the conditions necessary to be able to calculate costs accurately.</seg>
<seg id="367">Prior information and contract notice</seg>
<seg id="368">Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authority is to publish a contract notice for interested businesses outlining the contracts to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="369">Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for EUwide</seg>
<seg id="370">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="371">The prior information notice has to include the essential specifications of the intended work project.</seg>
<seg id="372">These notices are required in the case of work projects whose estimated total contract value is equal to or higher than the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadlines for submitting tenders in open or restricted procedures.</seg>
<seg id="373">The contracting authority has to publish a contract notice with detailed information on any public works contract that requires EU-wide tendering.</seg>
<seg id="374">Once published, this information is binding on the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="375">Among other information, the contract notice has to include the specifications, the deadlines for the procedure and the performance of the contract, the special requirements, the award criteria and their weighting.</seg>
<seg id="376">The EU-wide common procurement vocabulary (CPV) must be used to describe the subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="377">The prior information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="378">To prevent any discrimination of foreign interested parties, notices published at national level may not contain any additional information and may not be published before the text of the notice has been posted to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">Incomplete or inaccurate information in the contract notice may impair competition and perhaps even facilitate manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="380">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="381">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="382">Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and contract notices in national law.</seg>
<seg id="383">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="384">In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for the works contracts for which EU-wide tendering is not required.</seg>
<seg id="385">Contract award procedures may not start earlier than one month after the publication of prior information in the EU’s Official Journal (in case of EU-wide award procedures) and in the national official gazette (in case of all award procedure).</seg>
<seg id="386">The publication of prior information can only be omitted in exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="387">In Germany, the publication of prior information is not needed in cases where no EU-wide tendering is required.</seg>
<seg id="388">In case of national tendering procedures public invitations to tender and competitions for participation preliminary to restricted invitations to tender must be publicly announced on the Federal Government’s website and, where appropriate, in newspapers orjournals.</seg>
<seg id="389">In case of restricted invitations to tender without competition for participation, notices have to be published where the estimated contract value amounts to or exceeds € 25,000 (ex ante transparency).</seg>
<seg id="390">Preliminary information notices must set forth all planned lots of the work projects.</seg>
<seg id="391">Given the small volumes of works contracts awarded in Germany, this is an important requirement.</seg>
<seg id="392">As the number of work projects divided into lots for purposes of tendering is much smaller in the Czech Republic, this provision is much less important there.</seg>
<seg id="393">Key audit findings</seg>
<seg id="394">BRH</seg>
<seg id="395">Preliminary information</seg>
<seg id="396">The contracting authorities audited published prior information for all public works projects that involved work to be contracted out by EU-wide tender.</seg>
<seg id="397">However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadlines for tendering at a time when the required minimum period of 52 days between sending preliminary information and sending the publications had not yet expired.</seg>
<seg id="398">In the case of other shortened procedures, tenders were invited only when the twelve-month validity period of the preliminary information had already expired and had not yet been extended.</seg>
<seg id="399">Many publications of preliminary information did not include advice to the effect that the total volume of work would be divided into lots.</seg>
<seg id="400">Contract notice</seg>
<seg id="401">Some of the contract notices issued by the audited bodies included CPV codes which deviated from the contents of preliminary information notices or did not accurately specify the work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="402">In isolated cases, the contract notices published at national level included more information – e.g. concerning performance deadlines – or were published earlier than the notices published in the European Union’s Official Journal.</seg>
<seg id="403">Ex-ante transparency</seg>
<seg id="404">The units of one construction administration had commissioned a service company with publishing the national notices.</seg>
<seg id="405">The latter published the notices on its own procurement platform for the use of which fees are charged.</seg>
<seg id="406">The construction authorities had however not checked whether this company had complied with the requirement to pass on the notices to the Federal Government’s free internet portal.</seg>
<seg id="407">Sample audits showed that only one third of the notices had been published on the latter portal.</seg>
<seg id="408">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="409">Contract notice</seg>
<seg id="410">In case of the construction of a water treatment plant, the contracting authority in its publication of award procedure to suppliers did not indicate the criteria it intended to apply in selecting tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="411">The contracting authority was not able to prove the way of bid selection.</seg>
<seg id="412">Reduction of number of bidders was, according to previous legislation, duly in place.</seg>
<seg id="413">In case of a road circle construction the contracting authority did not specify the figures for evaluation of compliance with qualification criteria and did not indicate the number of bidders to be invited nor in publication of restricted procedure opening neither in the contract award documentation.</seg>
<seg id="414">The contracting authority evaluated the qualification requirements of all 6 bidders in the restricted procedure as being complied with, but one bidder was excluded because he met the qualification requirements on the last sixth position.</seg>
<seg id="415">These steps of contracting authority were not transparent, because no information concerning the qualification particulars evaluation and the method of evaluation had ever been published.</seg>
<seg id="416">Publication of notices</seg>
<seg id="417">In case of ex-military areas reconstructions, the contracting authority did not publish the written invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="418">Conclusions and recommendations / summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="419">The two-stage information procedure with prior information and contract notice is an important instrument for implementing the transparency requirement that applies to EU-wide tendering procedures and thus for enhancing competition and preventing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="420">By extending the obligation to publish prior information to national tendering procedures in the Czech Republic and by applying this obligation in Germany in cases of open and restricted tendering, both countries have implemented EU requirements and thus increased the transparency of national tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="421">Selection of candidates in case of restricted tendering procedures</seg>
<seg id="422">In contrast to public tendering procedures, restricted tendering procedures do not permit all potential contractors who are interested in winning the contract to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="423">Under restricted procedures, the contracting authority must previously select potential contractors that will be asked to submit a tender.</seg>
<seg id="424">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="425">The EU provisions permit a limitation of the number of candidates in EU-wide restricted tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="426">However, restricted procedure requires at least five candidates to be asked to submit tenders and in the case of negotiated procedures with previous publication of a contract notice at least three potential contractors must be invited.</seg>
<seg id="427">In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.</seg>
<seg id="428">The selection criteria must be objective and nondiscriminatory and must be published in advance.</seg>
<seg id="429">The selection of potential contractors to be invited is a stage within the tendering procedure which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. undue preference being given to certain contractors.</seg>
<seg id="430">Moreover, the restriction of competition to few contractors may facilitate collusive tendering.</seg>
<seg id="431">In both case, such practices may considerably deteriorate the result of thetendering procedure to the disadvantage of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="432">Therefore, the latter, must make special arrangements to prevent manipulations, to ensure that adequate controls are in place and that this stage in the procedure is transparent and plausible.</seg>
<seg id="433">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="434">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="435">The provisions on the selection of candidates are similar in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="436">In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities are to alternate among the contractors to be invited.</seg>
<seg id="437">It is also not permitted to restrict competition to contractors domiciled in particular regions.</seg>
<seg id="438">The contracting authorities have to document and justify the selection of bidders and the course of the selection procedure in the contract award memos.</seg>
<seg id="439">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="440">In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in the case of restricted tendering and several suitable candidates in the case of awards by negotiated contract.</seg>
<seg id="441">Except in two specific cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of invited tenderers in case of restricted and negotiated procedure.</seg>
<seg id="442">In Germany, it is required to observe the crosscheck principle when selecting the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="443">If, e.g. one staff member has proposed a list of candidates, a senior manager of the construction administration or a commissioned staff member of the contracting authority must as a rule modify this proposal e.g. by deleting one of the candidates from the list and/or by adding a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="444">This is to prevent that a single individual can finally determine the circle of candidates participating in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="445">In the absence of such a requirement, far-reaching collusion among the participants would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="446">The list of candidates to be invited must be treated confidentially and not generally divulged.</seg>
<seg id="447">This also applies to self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="448">In the Czech Republic, no similar provisions on the drawing up and confidential treatment of lists of candidates are in place.</seg>
<seg id="449">Under the German provisions, self-employed professionals may not determine the candidates to be invited but may make proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="450">Czech rules do not deal with this issue</seg>
<seg id="451">Key audit results</seg>
<seg id="452">BRH</seg>
<seg id="453">Number of bidders</seg>
<seg id="454">With few exceptions, the requirement for a minimum number of potential contractors to be asked to submit tenders in case of restricted procedures was complied with.</seg>
<seg id="455">An analysis of nearly 7,000 tendering procedures for building construction limited to the national level showed that, in the case of Federal Government restricted procedures, the contracting authorities invited on average 6.6 potential contractors and, in the case of negotiated contracts, on average 4.4 potential contractors.</seg>
<seg id="456">Change of contractors and regional restrictions</seg>
<seg id="457">Especially where building trades with few contractors were involved, the contracting authorities did not make any changes in the circle of selected contractors.</seg>
<seg id="458">Above all, contractors already known for their good performance were considered more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="459">The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of non-public procedures, they were bound to ensure the suitability of the contractors to be asked to submit tenders even before actually asking them.</seg>
<seg id="460">While there was no evidence for illicit restrictions to bidders located in the region, the circle of bidders in the restricted tendering procedures included a larger portion of regional bidders than was the case in public tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="461">The contracting construction authorities attributed this mainly to the smaller contract volumes in comparison to those of public tenders which made long ways to the site a more significant cost item.</seg>
<seg id="462">Cross-checking principles, proposals of self-employed professionals</seg>
<seg id="463">The contract-awarding authorities largely disregarded the provisions on the fundamental change of the list of proposed contractors by an independent person.</seg>
<seg id="464">They especially argued the shortage of staff resources for processing, time pressure or inadequate knowledge about alternative suitable contractors.</seg>
<seg id="465">In many cases, the records did not indicate who had proposed the contractors to be asked to submit tenders.</seg>
<seg id="466">The audit of some samples revealed that the lists of potential bidders had been made by self- employed professionals and had been adopted by the contracting authorities without any changes.</seg>
<seg id="467">Thus, the contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves against potential manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="468">Confidential treatment of lists of potential contractors</seg>
<seg id="469">In one contracting authority, the lists of the contractors to be asked for tenders were held on a data-processing system to which all staff of that authority had read access.</seg>
<seg id="470">If there had been any intent to manipulate, the unauthorised divulgation of the names of the envisaged or admitted bidders would have been possible which might have enabled contractors to commit price-fixing.</seg>
<seg id="471">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="472">Only in few cases did the documentation of contract award procedures show reasons for the selection of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="473">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="474">Selection of bidders</seg>
<seg id="475">In case of a road circle the bidders had no information about the items of the qualification to be assesed and in which way.</seg>
<seg id="476">In case of development and modernization of water ways and ports, notices of tender in restricted procedure did not indicate criteria of reduction of the bidders.</seg>
<seg id="477">All eight participating bidders complied with the qualification requirements, but the limited number of bidders was thus exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thereafter, the committee proceeded on the basis of accidental selection – by drawing, which, at that time, was a legal step.</seg>
<seg id="479">This way of selection, however, should have been mentioned as one of criteria just in the tender notice.</seg>
<seg id="480">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="481">Given the high risk of manipulation in the selection of bidders in restricted contract award procedures, both countries have introduced special arrangements to prevent illicit restrictions of competition.</seg>
<seg id="482">The German rules restrict such opportunities for manipulation by means of the cross-check principle, by keeping lists of bidders confidential and by restricting the authority to make proposals for the selection of bidders to the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="483">Under the new Czech rules potential manipulative restrictions tend to be prevented mainly by the requirement that the number of bidders in restricted procedures must be unlimited.</seg>
<seg id="484">However, the audit evidence generated revealed that part of these rules was poorly implemented and that the potential for an abusive restriction of the circle of bidders was not adequately reduced in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="485">The contract-awarding authorities should completely eliminate the deficiencies pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="486">Tendering phase</seg>
<seg id="487">The tendering phase, in which potential contractors may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents which they have received, begins with the publication of the contract notice and/or with the invitation of tenders.</seg>
<seg id="488">Potential tenderers may submit tenders until expiry of the deadline for submission, prescribed by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="489">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="490">EU law does not impose special requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contracting authorities have to comply with the national provisions designed to counteract the potential for manipulation that exists during the bidding phase.</seg>
<seg id="492">Such compliance especially relates to organiational arrangements and controls.</seg>
<seg id="493">Provision of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="494">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="495">As a matter of principle, the tender documents on the basis of which the potential contractors are to work out their bids must always be sent out by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="496">Private independent professionals involved in the tendering procedure may not perform this task.</seg>
<seg id="497">The contracting authority has to make sure, that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.</seg>
<seg id="498">In case of ambiguities in the tender documents or where other questions arise, only the contracting authority may furnish information to the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="499">The independent professionals commissioned to draw up the tender documents may not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="500">During the entire tendering phase, any direct contact between the commissioned independent professionals and the candidates must be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="501">The firms are not to become a turntable of the contract awarding procedure which enables contacts to be made that adversely affect competition.</seg>
<seg id="502">Tenders forwarded by post or directly have to be submitted in a closed envelope.</seg>
<seg id="503">Tenders communicated electronically must be technically encoded.</seg>
<seg id="504">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="505">In Germany, the contracting authority may commission external service providers to print and send out the tender documents, whose staff must be made to pledge to keep the bids secret and to perform contractual obligations with due care.</seg>
<seg id="506">In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with a date of receipt stamp and directly and immediately forwarded unopened to a public servant who is responsible for keeping them in custody.</seg>
<seg id="507">This public servant must not be involved in the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="508">The tenders received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.</seg>
<seg id="510">The contracting authority draws up a memo with the tender data including contract numbers and information about the drawing up and receipt.</seg>
<seg id="511">There are no detailed provisions about the custody of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="512">Key audit findings</seg>
<seg id="513">BRH</seg>
<seg id="514">BRH audits of the tendering phase focused on the contract award procedures of one building construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="515">Posting of contract documents</seg>
<seg id="516">The contract awarding authorities of the building construction administration audited either posted the tender documents themselves or had them printed and posted by an external service company.</seg>
<seg id="517">Self-employed professionals did not post any tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="518">Information furnished to bidders</seg>
<seg id="519">In its designation of the contacts for making queries and obtaining information, the audited building construction administration largely did not comply with the rules for separating planning from the contract award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="520">Contrary to applicable provisions, it often did not name staff of the contract awarding authority as contact in the specifications but rather staff from the project management units.</seg>
<seg id="521">Some contract award notifications even included the names of the firms of self-employed professionals who had drawn up the tender documents.</seg>
<seg id="522">There were isolated cases in which bidders who made inquiries during the bidding stage did not receive identical information.</seg>
<seg id="523">Marking of tenders</seg>
<seg id="524">In the construction administration audited, all tenders received were marked with a received stamp and a receipt note.</seg>
<seg id="525">In the case of some negotiated procedures, however, the tenders were received by self-employed professionals, a practice which prevention rules. infringed the corruption</seg>
<seg id="526">Úschova nabídek</seg>
<seg id="527">Ne všechny nabídky byly poslány přímo a bez zpoždění k oficiálnímu uložení, aby byly uzamčeny v ocelové schránce.</seg>
<seg id="528">In one construction authority, the tenders were temporarily placed in an open pigeonhole of the post room to which each staff member had access.</seg>
<seg id="529">Another authority had placed a letter-box in a corridor not under constant surveillance and the tenders thrown into this box partly remained there over night.</seg>
<seg id="530">Since the slot of that letter-box was large and unsecured, not only staff of the authority would have been able to retrieve and manipulate tenders received.</seg>
<seg id="531">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="532">No shortcomings found out in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="533">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="534">Provisions are in place in both countries which are to prevent contacts especially between interested enterprises and independent professionals involved in the contract award procedure during the tendering stage.</seg>
<seg id="535">Equal treatment is to be ensured by furnishing the same information to all bidders.</seg>
<seg id="536">The rules for the reception, custody and secrecy of the tenders appear suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.</seg>
<seg id="537">In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more comprehensive than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="538">The audit evidence generated in Germany has highlighted infringements of the rules in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="539">These deficiencies could be remedied with a small input of resources.</seg>
<seg id="540">Opening of the envelopes</seg>
<seg id="541">Opening of envelopes</seg>
<seg id="542">During the bid-opening session, the bids that so far have remained closed will be opened and their contents will be read out and published.</seg>
<seg id="543">The period during which the bidder is bound by his tender begins at a moment of bidders´ submission date expiry, eventually at the moment of envelopes opening, and ends by deadline set by contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="544">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="545">EU law does not include any specific provisions about the opening of envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="546">However, national laws and regulations comprise extensive requirements for the protection of the bids and of the competition during this highly sensitive phase of the contract award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="547">The crosscheck principle and the transparency and traceability of the opening of envelopes are to prevent manipulations and modifications of the tenders submitted.</seg>
<seg id="548">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="549">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="550">The bid-opening session must be conducted by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="551">Compliance with the crosscheck principle is to prevent that individuals can manipulate bids without this being noticed.</seg>
<seg id="552">In both countries, the bidders may in majority of cases attend opening session.</seg>
<seg id="553">The envelopes when being opened, must have been lain in front of the leader of the proceedings when the first bid was opened.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bids that have been received late may never be considered.</seg>
<seg id="555">In order to ensure the transparency of the opening session, the actions taken and the results of bid-opening are to be recorded and the record, among other information, must contain the names of the bidders and the prices quoted.</seg>
<seg id="556">The minutes must be read out and must be signed by the leader of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="557">The bidders present may also sign the minutes.</seg>
<seg id="558">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="559">In the Czech Republic, a committee is in charge of the opening of bids.</seg>
<seg id="560">The participation of independent professionals is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="561">The Committee may be tasked with conducting subsequent phases of the contract award procedure, e.g. the evaluation of bids.</seg>
<seg id="562">In Germany, the opening of bids is conducted by a leader of proceedings and a keeper of the minutes.</seg>
<seg id="563">The leader of proceedings must be a staff member of a contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="564">The leader of proceedings and – in the case of building construction – the keeper of the minutes are not to be involved in drawing up the tender documents, in awarding the contract and in contract management.</seg>
<seg id="565">The German provisions demand that the minutes of the opening session include not only the prices quoted by bidders but also any information about discounts and rebates and extraordinary features e.g. bids received that were damaged or arrived late.</seg>
<seg id="566">In the Czech Republic, the minutes of the opening session put on record – apart from the prices quoted by bidders – the language of the bid and the applicant’s authority to sign it.</seg>
<seg id="567">The German provisions require that all parts of the opened bids must be marked so as to prevent any subsequent modifications and amendments.</seg>
<seg id="568">The bids, which are usually marked by perforation with the date of the opening session, must be kept secret after the opening session and may be made accessible only to the persons commissioned with processing them.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are no similar Czech provisions.</seg>
<seg id="570">If only one bid is received in any contract award procedure in the Czech Republic, the bid may not be opened and is to be returned without any evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="571">In Germany, no similar provision exists. If only one bid is received, it has to be opened and subsequently evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="572">Basic audit findings</seg>
<seg id="573">BRH</seg>
<seg id="574">Cross-checking principle</seg>
<seg id="575">During the bid-opening sessions, the contracting authorities audited complied with the crosschecking requirement.</seg>
<seg id="576">They conducted the bidopening sessions always with a session leader and a minute writer to whom no other tenderrelated tasks had been assigned.</seg>
<seg id="577">In isolated cases of smaller negotiated contracts, however, self-employed professionals opened tenders sent to them, without involvement of the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="578">Minutes</seg>
<seg id="579">The minutes of the bid-opening sessions did not always completely document the opening of bids.</seg>
<seg id="580">In some cases, the bids that had been submitted late were not included and in some cases, even signatures were missing.</seg>
<seg id="581">Marking of bids</seg>
<seg id="582">The contracting authorities examined in the course of the horizontal audit marked the bids by perforation with the date of the bid-opening session, thereby complying with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="583">Audits of grant recipients conducted in the past, had revealed inadequate marking.</seg>
<seg id="584">These contracting authorities changed their marking practice in response to the BRH’s objection.</seg>
<seg id="585">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="586">Time limit for the receipt of tenders</seg>
<seg id="587">In case of contracts awarded for road repairs, one bid was received by the contracting authority only one month after expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless admitted this bid.</seg>
<seg id="588">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="589">The rules in place in the two countries for opening the envelopes are largely identical. They take into account both the cross-check principle and the principle of transparency which permits a significant restriction of the risks of corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="590">The German rules are more comprehensive than those of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="591">Especially the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure, on the marking, safe custody and secrecy of the tenders substantially restrict subsequent changes of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="592">Moreover, the officials responsible for opening the envelopes may not perform any other functions in connection with the contracts to be awarded.</seg>
<seg id="593">The fact that the audits revealed few contraventions proves that the rules for the opening of envelopes are largely accepted.</seg>
<seg id="594">Examination and evaluation of tenders</seg>
<seg id="595">The contracting authority has to examine and evaluate the tenders that have been received by the envelope-opening day.</seg>
<seg id="596">It has to award the contract to the tender which best meets the award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="597">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="598">EU law provides for a procedure in several stages:</seg>
<seg id="599">The first step is to determine the suitability of the tenderers.</seg>
<seg id="600">These must have a good economic and financial standing and the required professional and technical knowledge or ability.</seg>
<seg id="601">Economic operators that have been convicted by final sentence for bribery or fraud must always be excluded from the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="602">The tenders of the tenderers not excluded must be evaluated in terms of arithmetical accuracy, technical feasibility and value for money and on the basis of the previously published contract award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="603">The contracting authority has to determine the economically most favourable tender. The contracting authority has to examine especially any abnormally low prices offered.</seg>
<seg id="604">The examination and evaluation stage of the tendering procedure is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="605">For instance, tenderers may be excluded without due cause or tenders that not meet the requirements may be kept in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="606">The result of the evaluation may unduly be influenced by giving preference to a tenderer or putting him at a disadvantage, thereby preventing the determination of the economically most favourable tender.</seg>
<seg id="607">The contracting authority therefore has to make special arrangements particularly to ensure that the persons commissioned with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and technical expertise.</seg>
<seg id="608">It also has to make sure that the tendering procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and plausible.</seg>
<seg id="609">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="610">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="611">In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries call for the examination and evaluation of tenders by successive stages.</seg>
<seg id="612">The requirements for the proofs of suitability to be submitted by the enterprises, the evaluation criteria for deciding about the award and the weighting of these criteria have been laid down in the contract notices or the tender documents and may not be changed during the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="613">After checking the suitability of tenderers, the suitability criteria may no longer be applied in the evaluation of the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="614">Such evaluation has to be made only on the basis of the contract award criteria.</seg>
<seg id="615">The tenders submitted must first be examined under formal criteria as to whether they are complete and whether they include conspicuous features that suggest an intention to manipulate.</seg>
<seg id="616">Where tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they have to be notified of this without delay.</seg>
<seg id="617">If the evaluation of tenders results in a price that appears inappropriately low, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment on this prior to the potential exclusion of his tender.</seg>
<seg id="618">The reasons for the decisions taken in the process must be documented transparently.</seg>
<seg id="619">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="620">In Germany, the tenders must be kept secret and only the persons commissioned to process them may have the right of access.</seg>
<seg id="621">Only the contracting authority may review the tenders and verify their arithmetical accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="622">This work may be assigned only to staff not involved in the contract award decision or the implementation of the project.</seg>
<seg id="623">There are no precise regulations as to who may perform the further examination and evaluation tasks.</seg>
<seg id="624">Where self-employed persons are commissioned to examine and evaluate the tenders, they have to honour the confidentiality of these tenders.</seg>
<seg id="625">They only may make decision proposals to the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="626">In the Czech Republic awarding committees are set up for checking and evaluating the tenders.</seg>
<seg id="627">The committees produce an evaluation report with proposals for the contract award.</seg>
<seg id="628">However, in both countries the ultimate decisions about contract awards are made only by the contracting authorities.</seg>
<seg id="629">If, in Germany, proofs or declarations required to be presented in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the contracting authority must give bidders the chance to submit the missing documents within six days.</seg>
<seg id="630">Only if the documents have not yet been received after expiry of this deadline, the bid must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="631">In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may at its own discretion decide whether or not to give bidders the opportunity to supplement missing proofs or declarations.</seg>
<seg id="632">Unless the bidder presents them he must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="633">In Germany, not only the total price of tenders has to be examined but also the unit prices (prices of work segments).</seg>
<seg id="634">If the price structure of the tender suggests that prices for parts of the work to be done have been estimated excessively low or high, the tenderer must be asked to clarify these issues.</seg>
<seg id="635">If he does not succeed in doing so and if the contracting authority can prove compensatory pricing, the tender in question must be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="636">This is to prevent that tenderers calculate their tenders on the basis of the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made for certain parts of the work performed, which may lead to significant increases in the cost of work projects.</seg>
<seg id="637">In the Czech Republic, the overall price is evaluated but not the appropriateness of prices for parts of the work.</seg>
<seg id="638">Compensatory pricing is no justification for the exclusion of a tender.</seg>
<seg id="639">In Germany, no contract may be awarded to tenders whose price is inappropriately high or low.</seg>
<seg id="640">Where one or few tenders differ by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, the tenderers must prove that their tenders have been soundly calculated.</seg>
<seg id="641">If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude these tenders.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once value for money has been examined, tenders in the Czech Republic may be cancelled if only tenders with an excessively low price that cannot be justified have been received.</seg>
<seg id="643">Where prices of tenders are substantially higher than the one estimated by the contracting authority, this is not a valid reason for refusing to award the contract to that tender (contrary to German procurement law).</seg>
<seg id="644">If, in Germany, there is a suspicion of behaviour restricting competition, the contracting authority must immediately report to the authority in charge of its technical oversight.</seg>
<seg id="645">The latter has to decide about the action to be taken and whether it is appropriate to inform the cartel authority (antitrust authority) or the public prosecution service.</seg>
<seg id="646">The oversight authority has to approve e.g. also where the works contract is worth more than € 50.000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest-priced tender, where the award is to be made by negotiated contract or where the tendering procedure is to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="647">Czech rules do not deal with this issue.</seg>
<seg id="648">Key audit findings</seg>
<seg id="649">BRH</seg>
<seg id="650">Examination of suitability and award criteria</seg>
<seg id="651">Most contract award procedures examined complied with the requirements set.</seg>
<seg id="652">In the case of some potential contractors recommended by self-employed professionals, the contract awarding authorities did not check the suitability of these companies themselves.</seg>
<seg id="653">One grant recipient commissioned contractors although the required proofs of suitability were not completely at hand.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the case of some tendering procedures, there was no sound evidence as to whether the contract awarding authority’s choice had taken into account all published award criteria or whether its contract award decision had been based only on the criterion of price.</seg>
<seg id="655">Selection of persons involved and secrecy of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="656">Some of the contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons.</seg>
<seg id="657">For instance, self-employed professionals or staff of the construction offices that were involved in the planning or implementation of a work project performed functions whose discharge was incumbent exclusively on the contract awarding authority.</seg>
<seg id="658">The construction authorities sought to justify this by inadequate staff resources in the sectors concerned.</seg>
<seg id="659">In some cases, the self-employed professionals commissioned to examine the tenders used staff that had not been formally obliged to keep the tenders secret and to exercise due care in the fulfilment of their contractual commitments.</seg>
<seg id="660">Concerning the construction authorities, there usually was no conclusive evidence as to whether the tenders, when in the custody of the self-employed professionals, were accessible only for the persons to which their processing was directly assigned.</seg>
<seg id="661">Review and arithmetical check of the tenders</seg>
<seg id="662">Some contracting authorities handed over the opened tenders to self-employed professionals for further examination without having first performed the prescribed review of tenders and arithmetical check and documented the results of these examinations.</seg>
<seg id="663">In case of any intention to manipulate, third parties could have made changes in the tenders which the contracting authorities would not have been able to identify.</seg>
<seg id="664">The documents examined revealed a number of cases in which unusual features were not adequately marked or where information about prices and products was missing.</seg>
<seg id="665">Performance audits</seg>
<seg id="666">A sample audit in a construction authority revealed that, in 75% of all contract award procedures, the most favourable tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimates made beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="667">One in twenty contract award procedures was cancelled owing to inappropriate tender prices.</seg>
<seg id="668">In a number of cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation about examinations of tenders or discussions with tenderers held to clarify questions.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, detailed information was missing, e.g. concerning unit prices of the most important items in the invoices.</seg>
<seg id="670">Factors such as changed market prices or increases of material costs were frequently given as reasons for the deviations.</seg>
<seg id="671">The construction authorities stated that identifying and proving compensatory pricing was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="672">In the case of one invitation to tender issued by a non-departmental body, the lowest price quoted in a tender was 66% lower than the previous estimate of the contract value.</seg>
<seg id="673">Closer examinations of costing or investigations to identify the causes of this deviation were not on record.</seg>
<seg id="674">In a discussion to clarify the question, the contract awarding authority did not find any evidence as to price dumping by the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.</seg>
<seg id="675">Thus, it remained unclear whether the previous estimate was excessive or the tender price was too low.</seg>
<seg id="676">Later, the contract awarding authority classified the contractor as “low-cost company” which was neither able to meet the quality requirements nor the deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="677">In another tendering procedure, the construction authority adjudicated the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.</seg>
<seg id="678">It did not cancel the tendering procedure, adducing the unfounded argument that the company in question could be expected not to base its pricing on unreasonably high costs.</seg>
<seg id="679">Suspicion of irregularities</seg>
<seg id="680">Two cases of irregularities were found in one audited construction authority and reported to the authority responsible for technical supervision.</seg>
<seg id="681">In one tendering procedure, two bidders submitted identical cost calculations which prompted the construction authority to exclude both tenders.</seg>
<seg id="682">The audits did not reveal any significant deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.</seg>
<seg id="683">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="684">Verification of the suitability</seg>
<seg id="685">In many of the construction projects audited such as university buildings, road and railway construction, and others, the contracting authorities did not exclude the bidders from participation in the procedure, even if they did not comply with the requirements of tender documentation or they did not prove their qualification in the extent prescribed. On the other hand, one contracting authority could neither prove nor explain the reason of excluding a bidder who complied with the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="686">Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="687">When awarding a contract for the construction of a water treatment plant the contracting authority did not base its examination and evaluation on the defined evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="688">In case of rail road construction, the contracting authority determined the weight of evaluation criteria as late as in the beginning of evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="689">In case of road repairs, the defined criterion of “construction period shortening” was evaluated inappropriately.</seg>
<seg id="690">As a result, the shortening offered by the bidders that were second and third in the competition was not adequately taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="691">Documentation of the reasons why a bidder was selected</seg>
<seg id="692">In three contract award procedures for the support of housing, the contracting authority did not document what criteria were used in the course of evaluation and what was the way of selection of successful bidder.</seg>
<seg id="693">When awarding small scale contracts worth up to €20 000 in connection with a motorway construction, the contracting authority selected the bidders only on the basis of telephone consultations concerning the prices and terms of deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="694">It was impossible to audit these selections, because these consultations were not documented.</seg>
<seg id="695">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="696">In both countries, the rules for examining and evaluating the tenders comply with EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="697">However, they differ with respect to detailed steps of the procedure and the selection of the individuals involved.</seg>
<seg id="698">In Germany, the steps of the procedure are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially concerning the implementation of the cross-check principle and the protection of bids than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="699">The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices quoted.</seg>
<seg id="700">In both countries it was found that in some of the cases audited essential steps of the procedure for examining and evaluating the tenders were not documented at all or, if they were, only incompletely.</seg>
<seg id="701">However, the lack of an audit trail and of transparency in respect of the decisions taken during examination and evaluation facilitates manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="702">A particularly grave deficiency was the handing over of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documentation of the tenders by the contract-awarding authority which would have prevented any manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="703">Where contract-awarding authorities commission third parties to perform functions in connection with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate arrangements and enhanced control are necessary to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="704">When auditing the appropriateness of prices, the audited administrative entities in Germany did not always make use of the complete range of tools available and thus inadequately explored the price structure.</seg>
<seg id="705">In the Czech Republic, the audit revealed irregularities especially in connection with the examination of suitability and the application of the evaluation criteria.</seg>
<seg id="706">Completion of the tendering procedure</seg>
<seg id="707">Once the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the tendering procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="708">Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="709">In case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be notified in advance of the contract award decision taken.</seg>
<seg id="710">The contractors have the opportunity to examine the intended decision within a period of 10 or 15 days and to seek a review where appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="711">No contract may be concluded before expiry of this period.</seg>
<seg id="712">If forwarded electronically or per fax, the limitation period is 10 days. If other means of communication are used, it is 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="713">If a bidder applies for review within the notification period, a contract may be concluded only after the final decision taken in the review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="714">Moreover, the enterprises may refer the award decision made under this procedure to an independent court of law for further review.</seg>
<seg id="715">The review is to ensure both legal protection given to the contractors and compliance with procurement law by the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="716">The contracting authority must adequately document the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="717">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="718">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="719">Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the information and review procedure.</seg>
<seg id="720">In both countries, the decision about awarding the contract lies with the contracting authority.</seg>
<seg id="721">The latter may however not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a duly conducted examination and evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="722">The contracting authority is to award the contract within the announced examination period.</seg>
<seg id="723">The reason is the fact that the bidders are no longer bound by their tenders once this period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="724">In open and restricted procedures and public or restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not stipulate a content of the contract which deviates from that of the tender.</seg>
<seg id="725">The unsuccessful bidders are to be notified on a timely basis of the award decision made and the reasons why their respective bids have not been accepted.</seg>
<seg id="726">The cancellation of tendering procedures is admissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices quoted in the tenders are excessivesind or the tenders do not conform to the specifications.</seg>
<seg id="727">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="728">In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15 days obligatory information and waiting period before awarding the contract also applies to work contracts that do not require Europe-wide tendering.</seg>
<seg id="729">In Germany, the equivalent provision only applies to EU-wide tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="730">In all other tendering procedures in Germany, the tenderers my not be informed about the contract award until the award decision has been taken.</seg>
<seg id="731">In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be cancelled, if only one tender has been received or only one tender met the requirements for being considered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="732">In Germany, the contract must also be awarded, if only one single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions set forth in the tender documents and is cost-effective.</seg>
<seg id="733">Key audit findings</seg>
<seg id="734">BRH</seg>
<seg id="735">Only few deficiencies in the completion of the tendering procedures audited were found.</seg>
<seg id="736">In some cases of EU-wide tendering, companies received commissioning letters before expiry of the notification period, which may render the contract void.</seg>
<seg id="737">Also, in some cases of open procedures, commissioning letters included modifications incompatible with the contents of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="738">In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the deadlines for awarding the contracts.</seg>
<seg id="739">In case of an open procedure, the contracting authority commissioned the second most favourable bidder, because a bidder whose tender price was more than 50 % lower was no longer willing to perform the contract at the price originally quoted.</seg>
<seg id="740">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="741">In case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority did not conclude the contract with the bidder in correspondence to the contract proposal indicated in the bid of selected supplier.</seg>
<seg id="742">In some contract award cases, such as repair and maintenance of the roads, construction of a motorway and of road circle, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts later than prescribed by law.</seg>
<seg id="743">In case of contracts awarded in the context of exmilitary areas reconstructions, contracting authority dispatched the information of selected bid to all bidders only after expiration of legal deadline.</seg>
<seg id="744">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="745">Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the completion of tendering procedures.</seg>
<seg id="746">The legal protection of unsuccessful bidders contributes to reducing corruption.</seg>
<seg id="747">Within Czech procurement law, the purview of legal protection also encompasses awards falling below EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="748">In both countries, it was found that the limitation period for awarding contracts had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="749">This may result in adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="750">In future, the construction authorities should eliminate such shortcomings in completing tender procedures.</seg>
<seg id="751">Documentation, notification and reporting duties</seg>
<seg id="752">During the successive steps of the contractaward procedures, relevant findings and decisions and their underlying reasons must be documented in a transparent way.</seg>
<seg id="753">In case of EUwide procedure, contract awards are to be publicly announced.</seg>
<seg id="754">The data on the contract awards are also included in EU statistics.</seg>
<seg id="755">Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="756">The obligation to document contract-award procedures complies with a basic requirement of the transparency principle that applies EU-wide.</seg>
<seg id="757">Only a careful and timely documentation ensures transparency as to the contract-award decisions and the reasons underlying them. In particular, it ensures the effective legal protection of bidders’ interests in cases where the contract value exceeds the EU thresholds.</seg>
<seg id="758">Due documentation is also an essential ingredient to corruption prevention since the obligation to give detailed justifications for contract-award decisions significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the case of EU-wide contract-award procedures, the contracting authorities have to notify all awards made under EU-wide contractaward procedures to the EU’s Office of Official Publications not later than 48 days after the contract award date.</seg>
<seg id="760">The Office publishes the notifications in the EU’s Official Journal and thus also honours the transparency requirement.</seg>
<seg id="761">The contracting authorities must collect the essential data on their contract-award procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.</seg>
<seg id="762">On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual statistics which enable it to obtain an overview of the development of the Single Market in the field of construction works.</seg>
<seg id="763">Provisions of German and Czech procurement law</seg>
<seg id="764">Identical or similar provisions</seg>
<seg id="765">Both countries have completely transposed into national law the provisions of EU law concerning documentation and notification.</seg>
<seg id="766">The provisions on documentation and notification for the purpose of EU statistics are largely identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="767">Differing provisions</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, the duty to publish contract awards does not only apply to EU-wide procurements but also to national contract-award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="769">The deadline for notification is only 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Germany, public announcement duties apart from those imposed by EU law apply only to restricted tendering exceeding a threshold of €25,000 and discretionary awarding of contracts (negotiated contracts) exceeding a threshold of €15,000 VAT excluded (so-called ex-post transparency).</seg>
<seg id="771">Below these thresholds and in the case of public tenders, only the participating enterprises are given information about the contract awards.</seg>
<seg id="772">Basic audit findings</seg>
<seg id="773">BRH</seg>
<seg id="774">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="775">A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not documented completly.</seg>
<seg id="776">The contract award notices did not include all necessary information about e.g. reasons for product specifications and national regulations.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the case of one tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not give any reason why it had awarded the contract to a bidder whose tender did not include obligatory proofs.</seg>
<seg id="778">In a few cases, documentation of the contracting authorities did not include all records required for documenting the tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="779">Publication of contract awards</seg>
<seg id="780">In the case of some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publish the contract award notices.</seg>
<seg id="781">In the case of several tendering procedures, the proofs for the publication of contract award notices by the contracting authorities were missing.</seg>
<seg id="782">Reporting duties</seg>
<seg id="783">The statistical compilations reviewed included the required minimum information and had been produced and posted on a timely basis.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ex-post transparency</seg>
<seg id="785">In most cases, the construction administrations audited published the contract data of the completed tendering procedure.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the case of one construction administration, however, these data were not published due to a communication error.</seg>
<seg id="787">It took the construction administration half a year to notice the mistake.</seg>
<seg id="788">As a result, contract data of the tendering procedures completed during that period were not published.</seg>
<seg id="789">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="790">Documentation</seg>
<seg id="791">In case of construction work connected with a large sports event considerable shortcomings in documentation in course of procurement procedure were found out, which concerned mainly incorrect data e.g. in evaluation committee records concerning the bid prices.</seg>
<seg id="792">In adition, some of the minutes about the opening of envelopes were not signed.</seg>
<seg id="793">Publication of contract awards</seg>
<seg id="794">In case of repairs and maintenance of road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded were distributed after the deadline, resp. they were not published.</seg>
<seg id="795">Summarised findings</seg>
<seg id="796">The provisions on documentation, reporting and notification implement the EU requirements and are largely identical in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="797">This generally ensures the transparency of contract-award procedures and award decisions.</seg>
<seg id="798">The Czech publication requirements are somewhat stricter than their German counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="799">The examination revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation and publication as a means of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="800">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="801">The construction authorities should further enhance the transparency of their contract award procedures and should fully meet reporting and notification requirements.</seg>
<seg id="802">Summarised evaluation and recommendations</seg>
<seg id="803">The parallel audits of the NKU and the BRH focused on two issues which are essential both in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the awarding of public works contracts: the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="804">The provisions of EU law provide the opportunity for international competition within the EU in order to create a European Single Market.</seg>
<seg id="805">Measures designed to prevent corruption do not only aim at avoiding or at least reducing corruption. They are also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of government.</seg>
<seg id="806">The audit findings generated by the two SAIs with respect to the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of the respective provisions of procurement law provide an insight into the common and differing features that may be helpful for both countries in further developing their procurement law and its application.</seg>
<seg id="807">Application of EU procurement law</seg>
<seg id="808">Both countries have transposed into national law the EU legislation concerning the awarding of public works contracts.</seg>
<seg id="809">Thus, an important common basis exists in both countries for the awarding of public works contracts and the compliance with the essential requirements in this field: competition; equal treatment of the participating enterprises and transparency of the contract award procedure.</seg>
<seg id="810">The construction administrations of both countries have underpinned these requirements by partly very extensive administrative regulations.</seg>
<seg id="811">The Czech Republic has largely adopted the provisions on public works contracts requiring EU-wide tendering for those contract award procedures that are below the EU threshold and are therefore governed by national law.</seg>
<seg id="812">However, the SAIs‘ audits revealed that the construction administrations did not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU-law.</seg>
<seg id="813">The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its contract award procedures in order to eliminate the deficiencies pointed out with respect to the implementation of EU requirements.</seg>
<seg id="814">In the Czech Republic, the audits furthermore identified the risks impacting on the value for money achieved in contract award procedures.</seg>
<seg id="815">For instance, incomplete specification of the public contract subject, resulting in need of extra works, often awarded in contradiction to the law. Furthermore, insufficient specification of the expected price was provided. Also, qualification requirements limited the possible number of bidders, thus restricting competition, namely in the area of transport constructions.</seg>
<seg id="816">Corruption prevention</seg>
<seg id="817">Our audits did not aim at detecting cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="818">One of the reasons was that the SAIs do not have the necessary tools at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="819">However, the SAIs can check whether the administrations of the two countries have adopted measures to curb corruption and manipulation in connection with awards of public works contracts and how these measures are applied.</seg>
<seg id="820">In respect of corruption prevention, the two countries have focused on different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="821">The German provisions mainly provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and checks as central elements of corruption prevention.</seg>
<seg id="822">The Czech provisions mainly aim at increasing the transparency of the procedures.</seg>
<seg id="823">BRH</seg>
<seg id="824">In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention are in place that apply to the entire federal administration.</seg>
<seg id="825">These principles have also been implemented in the requirements for awarding public works contracts and have been adapted to meet the special needs of such contract awards.</seg>
<seg id="826">The relevant provisions specify, partly with great precision, the ways in which the requirements of corruption prevention need to be met in the course of the contract award procedure and the selection of the persons involved in them.</seg>
<seg id="827">In the BRH’s opinion, especially the principle that preference must be given to open procedures or public invitations to tender is a suitable tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in connection with the awarding of public works contracts, while restrictions of competition increase the risk of manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="828">Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the cross-check principle), the requirements concerning transparency, the documentation of contract award procedures and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.</seg>
<seg id="829">We therefore do not perceive any need for fundamental changes of the respective provisions public entities have to comply with when awarding public works contracts.</seg>
<seg id="830">The provisions on corruption prevention are largely implemented in practice.</seg>
<seg id="831">The deficiencies found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in complying with some requirements.</seg>
<seg id="832">Therefore, the construction administrations should offer further training to their staff to enhance their familiarity with the requirements for corruption prevention and further increase their awareness of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="833">An essential part of the weaknesses highlighted referred to tasks which the construction administrations had delegated to self-employed professionals.</seg>
<seg id="834">However, in the absence of adequate checks and controls, the delegation of tasks increases the risk of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="835">Tasks vulnerable to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be assigned to third parties, if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against undue interference.</seg>
<seg id="836">NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Republic adopted on governmental level the anti-corruption strategies which focus on public procurement.</seg>
<seg id="838">Essential amendments of the Act on public contracts award and connecting implementation rules were made.</seg>
<seg id="839">The NKÚ audits were carried out in the period of realization of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="840">The adopted strategy and new legal provisions may represent the efficient measures for improvement, whereas the contracting authorities have to justify effectiveness of public contracts, calculation of expected prices, adequacy of qualification requirements, definition of the basic evaluation criteria and the way of bid evaluation, and all that must be duly documented and published.</seg>
<seg id="841">Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="842">On the whole, the NKU and BRH have a favourable opinion about the way the EU requirements are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="843">The fact that they are largely accepted in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for awarding public works contracts within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="844">The supranational model implemented in the European Union may also serve as a basis for similar projects designed to facilitate and encourage international competition.</seg>
<seg id="845">In view of the enormous potential for material and ideal damage from manipulation and corruption in connection with the awarding of public works projects, both SAIs hold that it is the duty of the construction administrations to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, where possible, to improve them.</seg>
<seg id="846">In particular, the organisational structures and processes of the contract award procedures should be monitored continuously for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond to any need for corrective action.</seg>
<seg id="847">Comparison of the Czech and the German practice indicates that the volume of open procedures offering the large space for competition and substantially decreasing the chances of corruption acts should be enforced in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="848">Also, an increased segmentation of construction work into lots may positively impact on achieved price, if it results in more competition due to a higher number of bidders.</seg>
<seg id="849">Ensuring the correct implementation of contract award procedures is an essential basis for efficient public sector procurement.</seg>
<seg id="850">In Germany, the procedures are organized by special state institutions, while in the Czech Republic, except of the transport constructions, they are organized by central institutions themselves or by their contractual entities.</seg>
<seg id="851">The SAIs of both countries wish to further develop the findings relevant to their work and, where appropriate, to raise the related issues with their respective Parliament and Government even beyond the completion of their joint project.</seg>
<seg id="852">Furthermore, both SAIs are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation described in this report are also matters of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), since the principles and findings expounded are of general importance for effectively curbing corruption and for ensuring that public works contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that good value for money is obtained.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.</seg>
<seg id="3">With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.</seg>
<seg id="5">As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.</seg>
<seg id="11">The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.</seg>
<seg id="12">This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="14">A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.</seg>
<seg id="16">With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.</seg>
<seg id="21">Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.</seg>
<seg id="23">A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="24">Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.</seg>
<seg id="26">It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.</seg>
<seg id="27">Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."</seg>
<seg id="28">Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.</seg>
<seg id="29">Il faut bien le faire.</seg>

<seg id="2">President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.</seg>
<seg id="13">Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Are consumers too deep in hock?</seg>
<seg id="2">A lot of observers think so, and, if they're right, the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="3">A sudden, forced cutback by consumers, who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity, would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments can't readily take up the slack.</seg>
<seg id="4">And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The worriers cite some worrisome trends.</seg>
<seg id="6">During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion, inflation-adjusted gross national product, disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30%, but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66%.</seg>
<seg id="7">And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income -- personal income after taxes -- has hit a high of about 18 1/2%.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, these figures don't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco, Mr. Durkin comments that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences." He adds: "We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, could persist for a while."</seg>
<seg id="10">But what about the debt burden?</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Durkin doubts that "there is some magic level" at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income "indicates economic problems." And, "more importantly," he says, "the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chart below shows why (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).</seg>
<seg id="13">The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be "lower in this cycle than earlier," Mr. Durkin says.</seg>
<seg id="15">He notes that some "revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit" being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, he says, "longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden."</seg>
<seg id="17">And if you "consider the changing distribution of credit," Mr. Durkin says, "much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families," that is, "those probably best able to handle it."</seg>
<seg id="18">Citing figures on home-equity loans, he notes that "11% of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts, but the proportion rises to 16% of homeowners in the $45,000-$60,000 income range and 23% of homeowners with income above $60,000." And much home-equity credit is used conservatively. "The most frequent use is home improvement, which presumably improves the value of the property," Mr. Durkin says.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, it isn't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain, as the chart shows, reassuringly below some earlier highs (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).</seg>
<seg id="20">A severe recession could, of course, raise delinquency rates, but so far the current levels of consumer debt don't seem to loom as a major threat.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers, conservative as ever, are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly.</seg>
<seg id="22">In July, consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending," Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, says. "As a result, household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63% of GNP."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consumers, credit cards in hand, aren't running amok through the shopping malls -- or putting the economy at any great risk.</seg>

<seg id="1">Despite politicians' hand-wringing about the federal budget, the government ended fiscal 1989 with a $152.08 billion deficit, about the same as the two previous years.</seg>
<seg id="2">Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report. "I suppose you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up," he said, "but you can't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we're not."</seg>
<seg id="3">The federal deficit was $155.15 billion in 1988 and $149.69 billion in 1987.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because the Resolution Trust Corp. couldn't spend the money fast enough, the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nevertheless, the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $136 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law by $16 billion, a reminder of that law's shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The law sets a deficit target of $100 billion for fiscal 1990.</seg>
<seg id="8">A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt, triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.</seg>
<seg id="9">The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neither side showed any sign of retreating.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meeting with reporters Friday, Mr. Darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the House, which would increase spending in future years.</seg>
<seg id="12">Underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years, the Treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt -- $240.86 billion -- exceeded spending on Social Security, the single largest government program.</seg>
<seg id="13">In all, federal outlays amounted to $1.143 trillion in 1989, up 7.5% from the previous year, the Treasury said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Federal revenues rose 9% to $990.79 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Treasury said a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year didn't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Treasury marked up its forecast by $17 million in July, but that proved to be about $5 billion too optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="17">The government ran a deficit of $6.16 billion in September, compared with a surplus of $10.17 billion in September 1988.</seg>
<seg id="18">Outlays for the month totaled $105.39 billion, up from $87.57 billion a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="19">The increase reflects spending on the S&L rescue as well as payroll and Social Security checks normally issued in October that were issued in September this year because Oct. 1 fell on a Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Revenues were $99.23 billion, up from $97.74 billion a year earlier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles</seg>
<seg id="2">After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.</seg>
<seg id="4">So where would they say the momentum is now?</seg>
<seg id="5">"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.</seg>
<seg id="8">Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.</seg>
<seg id="10">His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is all each of these players has left now.</seg>
<seg id="13">18 holes to make a mark.</seg>
<seg id="14">The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.</seg>
<seg id="15">Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.</seg>
<seg id="18">Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Talk of European glory remains premature, though.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.</seg>
<seg id="21">A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="24">Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Cup final day</seg>
<seg id="2">Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.</seg>
<seg id="5">The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.</seg>
<seg id="9">Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.</seg>
<seg id="10">Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="13">They earned a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday, a surprising choice, but given the Swedish Academy's past perversities, hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee.</seg>
<seg id="2">In Spain, anyway, the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years, the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct, vivid prose, beginning with "The Family of Pascal Duarte" (1942).</seg>
<seg id="3">Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War, or left Spain when Franco triumphed, Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general's side, no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds, murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land.</seg>
<seg id="4">Still, it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte, a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell: "Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path, and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness.</seg>
<seg id="6">The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts."</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones, his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues, novels, short story collections and poetry.</seg>
<seg id="8">These days, he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958, describing in his travel book "Viaje a la Alcarria" how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns, now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of his 10 novels, "The Hive" (1951), full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa, a foul-mouthed, broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth, used to be available in English, translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press, which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here is an excerpt:</seg>
<seg id="12">The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both are young, one twenty odd, the other thirty odd.</seg>
<seg id="15">The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award, the younger one looks like a novelist.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines: "I've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title `Teresa de Cepeda, ' and in it I've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which . . ."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Oh, yes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Will you pour me a drop of water, if you don't mind?"</seg>
<seg id="19">"With pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="20">I've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text."</seg>
<seg id="21">"How interesting."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I think so.</seg>
<seg id="23">I don't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in, but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment . . ."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Rest assured, we proceed with exemplary fairness."</seg>
<seg id="25">"I don't doubt it for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="26">It does not matter if one is defeated, provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's so discouraging is . . ."</seg>

<seg id="1">North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust</seg>
<seg id="2">North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.</seg>
<seg id="4">"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."</seg>
<seg id="6">While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.</seg>
<seg id="8">North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.</seg>
<seg id="9">Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.</seg>
<seg id="14">The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."</seg>
<seg id="18">China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."</seg>
<seg id="20">The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="23">He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."</seg>
<seg id="24">North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."</seg>
<seg id="25">He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.</seg>

<seg id="1">Harvard students take course in getting enough rest</seg>
<seg id="2">A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'</seg>
<seg id="3">An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.</seg>
<seg id="6">'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.</seg>
<seg id="8">The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.</seg>
<seg id="12">In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="13">A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.</seg>
<seg id="14">'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.</seg>
<seg id="15">But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.</seg>
<seg id="16">The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.</seg>
<seg id="20">The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.</seg>
<seg id="21">Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.</seg>

<seg id="1">One of Ronald Reagan's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for "consensus" in various international institutions.</seg>
<seg id="2">In fact, he liberated the U.S. from one of the world's most corrupt organizations -- UNESCO.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the U.N. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education, science and culture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ever since, the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now UNESCO apologists are lobbying President Bush to renege on President Reagan's decision to depart.</seg>
<seg id="6">But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond.</seg>
<seg id="7">The U.S., along with Britain and Singapore, left the agency when its anti-Western ideology, financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention, such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case, but even his replacement, the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor, has had little success at achieving reforms.</seg>
<seg id="10">Several ridiculous projects continue, including the "New International Economic Order," which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else's statism.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Orwellian "New World Information Order" would give government officials rights against the press; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government, which would have licensing and censorship powers and, indeed, duties to block printing of "wrong" ideas.</seg>
<seg id="12">UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into "peoples' rights." Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as "ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament" and "the impact of the activities of transnational corporations."</seg>
<seg id="13">The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Glasnost may be partly responsible, but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted, "The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO."</seg>
<seg id="15">UNESCO is now holding its biennial meetings in Paris to devise its next projects.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Mayor's hope that references to "press freedom" would survive unamended seems doomed to failure; the current phrasing is "educating the public and media to avoid manipulation." He hasn't been able to replace the M'Bow cabal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soviets remain in charge of education programs, a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture, and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of the agency's 2,750 staff members, 230 are in the field working on actual projects, such as literacy and oceanographic research.</seg>
<seg id="19">The position of the United States, which once contributed 25% of the budget, is that nothing has changed.</seg>
<seg id="20">John Bolton, the assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told Congress that the continuing "statist, restrictive, nondemocratic" programs make rejoining any time soon "extremely unlikely." This hasn't much bothered the UNESCO delegates, who last week couldn't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other countries, including West Germany, may have a hard time justifying continued membership.</seg>
<seg id="22">We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries.</seg>
<seg id="24">Free markets, free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation.</seg>
<seg id="26">This can have its purposes at times, but there's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice.</seg>
<seg id="27">We can see plenty of reasons to stay out, and none to rejoin UNESCO.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants, and proposed $7.3 million in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer.</seg>
<seg id="2">The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the company's Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.</seg>
<seg id="3">OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane-safety, record-keeping and other requirements.</seg>
<seg id="4">A second citation covering the company's Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million in fines.</seg>
<seg id="5">Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, "The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards."</seg>
<seg id="6">OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, "yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Particularly flagrant," Mrs. Dole said, "are the company's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies." That settlement was in April 1987.</seg>
<seg id="9">A USX spokesman said the company hadn't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine. "Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said. "No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees."</seg>
<seg id="10">USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that, if and when safety problems were identified, they were corrected.</seg>
<seg id="12">The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants," said Linda Anku, OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="15">USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.</seg>
<seg id="16">Before the USX case, OSHA's largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company is contesting the fine.</seg>

<seg id="1">There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2">After years of mistrust born of Watergate, past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Iran-Contra scandal, President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now, at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn't been seen in years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the past week, the president has agreed to keep the committee informed, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing.</seg>
<seg id="5">That wasn't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so.</seg>
<seg id="7">Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite objections by the CIA, Mr. Bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the CIA who would be independent of the CIA director.</seg>
<seg id="9">In return, the Senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the CIA didn't get back in the assassination game.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We've finally been able to convince them that Casey and {Oliver} North don't work here anymore," says one administration official.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new understanding didn't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light.</seg>
<seg id="13">It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this month's failed coup attempt in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="14">The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The president also hinted he might veto this year's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive.</seg>
<seg id="17">Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) and Vice Chairman William Cohen (R., Maine), for their part, angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. Noriega.</seg>
<seg id="18">The White House got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who don't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, Mr. Bush and his aides made it clear they respected Congress's role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. Boren and the moderate Mr. Cohen to iron out their differences.</seg>
<seg id="20">The senators responded in kind.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sen. Cohen said the relationship has reverted to its pre-Reagan character.</seg>
<seg id="23">There still are some details to be nailed down.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Bush is reserving the right in "rare" instances to keep Congress in the dark, asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn't recognize.</seg>
<seg id="25">And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, both sides may face political critics.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much.</seg>
<seg id="28">And they continue anonymously attacking CIA Director William Webster for being too accommodating to the committee.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the same time, some congressional liberals will accuse Sens.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boren and Cohen of wimping out, and they will warn that the lawmakers' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities, the country could be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards, while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky Congress will balk.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Baltimore, who has just been named president of Rockefeller University, already knows what it's like to go through life with "Nobel laureate" appended to one's name.</seg>
<seg id="2">He is currently experiencing what it's like to have the phrase, "under investigation for scientific fraud," also attached to his name.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Nobel committee made the first addition; John Dingell's congressional committee created the second.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both of Dr. Baltimore's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution.</seg>
<seg id="5">It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore's impending appointment.</seg>
<seg id="6">They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee, which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore.</seg>
<seg id="7">Readers of these columns ("The Science Police," May 15) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee's larger investigation, which touched MIT, Tufts, Duke, the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper.</seg>
<seg id="9">Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding, the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron, whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era.</seg>
<seg id="10">This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science.</seg>
<seg id="11">John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore, animal-rights activists do $3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis, Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows, Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments, and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for "violating" EPA rules.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country isn't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell. (Mr.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dingell, by the way, has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper, adding to several previous investigations.</seg>
<seg id="14">Something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here.)</seg>
<seg id="15">Fortunately, there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out.</seg>
<seg id="16">David Hubel, a Nobel laureate at Harvard, has taken the lead in defending research with animals, as has Dr. Michael DeBakey.</seg>
<seg id="17">NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good, today it is also about power.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a media-linked world, scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work, but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content, funding and goals of that work.</seg>
<seg id="20">When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces, his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake, and offer their public support.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.</seg>
<seg id="6">And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="8">Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.</seg>
<seg id="10">They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.</seg>
<seg id="11">A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.</seg>
<seg id="13">Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.</seg>
<seg id="17">Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.</seg>
<seg id="18">Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.</seg>
<seg id="20">Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.</seg>

<seg id="1">The world had a big yuk recently when the Soviets reported a rash of UFO landings, one of them bringing tall aliens who glowed in the dark to Voronezh.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is the opinion of Timothy Good, author of "Above Top Secret: The World UFO Cover-Up" (Quill/William Morrow, 592 pages, $12.95), that the world laughs too fast.</seg>
<seg id="3">Here is a bible for UFO watchers, complete with pictures of people who say they've had personal relationships with aliens.</seg>
<seg id="4">One photo shows a woman sporting a scar she says was made by a laser beam (a low-caliber weapon, from the looks of the wound).</seg>
<seg id="5">So far anyway, our alien visitors seem more intent on brightening our skies than pulverizing us.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Good devotes much serious space to the events of Feb. 25, 1942, when American gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="7">Air-raid sirens sounded the alarm at 2:25 a.m., summoning 12,000 air wardens to duty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Soon all hell broke loose.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ground batteries, targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds, opened up a furious fusillade.</seg>
<seg id="10">The sky filled with 12.8-pound shells, several of which fell back to Earth, destroying homes and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the smoke cleared, six people were dead (three from heart attacks), and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Good, who documents these things as best he can, provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt: "1,430 pounds of ammunition," he wrote his commander in chief, were expended on "unidentified aircraft," flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet.</seg>
<seg id="13">Well, thousands of Californians on the scene insisted the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large, hardy UFO, but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings.</seg>
<seg id="14">One thing's for sure: There have been a ton of them, and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest.</seg>
<seg id="15">Gerald Ford, a fairly down-to-earth fellow, once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee recommending that "there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think we owe it to the American people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject."</seg>
<seg id="17">Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise: "If I become president, I'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public, and the scientists.</seg>
<seg id="18">I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one. . . ."</seg>
<seg id="19">But you know about campaign promises.</seg>
<seg id="20">It still doesn't look like governments are coughing up everything they know.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone, the visitors do seem to keep coming and, like the recent sightings, there's often a detail or two that suggests they may actually be a little on the dumb side.</seg>
<seg id="22">For instance, witnesses in Voronezh say the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend, after strolling around the city park, left behind some rocks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now why, you have to ask yourself, would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe?</seg>
<seg id="24">Or land in Russia so often.</seg>
<seg id="25">In a 1961 incident, a Soviet mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in Sverdlovsk.</seg>
<seg id="26">A search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's more, the seven mail personnel aboard were missing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, you have to ask the obvious question: Why would intelligent beings kidnap seven Soviet mailmen?</seg>
<seg id="29">Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find they've taken over "The Today Show," the way they overwhelm an entire town in Jack Finney's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 216 pages, $8.95).</seg>
<seg id="30">Maybe some of our talk-show hosts and anchors have already been taken over?</seg>
<seg id="31">The point of this 1955 novel, which spawned two movies, is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks.</seg>
<seg id="32">Another guy who thinks they're out there and closing fast is Whitley Strieber, whose new novel, "Majestic" (Putnam, 317 pages, $18.95), takes a look at a reported 1947 UFO crash near the Roswell Army Air Field in a New Mexico desert.</seg>
<seg id="33">Mr. Strieber knows a lot about aliens.</seg>
<seg id="34">He even had sex with one -- sort of, and not intentionally -- as readers learned in his "Communion" (a book recently described in the New York Times as a "nonfiction best seller").</seg>
<seg id="35">The way Mr. Strieber tells it in his earnest prose, the intelligence officer who found the craft's strange debris was forced by the government to call the flower-inscribed scraps parts of a weather balloon.</seg>
<seg id="36">The apparent crash became top secret, and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings.</seg>
<seg id="37">We lost our chance to communicate with sweet-natured visitors "about four feet tall {who} looked as though they were made of puffed-up marshmallow."</seg>

<seg id="1">Richard G. Sim, the man credited with transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools, hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company's latest acquisition, Barry Wright Corp.</seg>
<seg id="2">The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time.</seg>
<seg id="3">But analysts, while applauding the acquisition, say Applied's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Barry Wright, acquired by Applied for $147 million, makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Watertown, Mass., company's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last year's earnings of $1.3 million, including $815,000 from a restructuring gain, were far below the year-earlier $8.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Besides spurring Barry Wright's sales, which were $201.7 million in 1988, Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line. "The question is how long it's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution," says F. John Mirek, an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee.</seg>
<seg id="8">The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Butler, Wis., manufacturer went public at $15.75 a share in August 1987, and Mr. Sim's goal then was a $29 per-share price by 1992.</seg>
<seg id="10">Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule, in August 1988.</seg>
<seg id="11">The stock has since softened, trading around $25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $23.00 in national over-the-counter trading.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $50 a share by the end of</seg>
<seg id="13">Reaching that goal, says Robert T. Foote, Applied's chief financial officer, will require "efficient reinvestment" of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19% rate of return on operating capital.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Barry Wright, Mr. Sim sees a situation "very similar" to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985.</seg>
<seg id="15">Applied, then a closely held company, was stagnating under the management of its controlling family.</seg>
<seg id="16">While profitable, it "wasn't growing and wasn't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied.</seg>
<seg id="18">He also professes an "evangelical" fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Sim considers the new unit's operations "fundamentally sound" and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that haven't interested larger competitors. "With a little patience, these businesses will perform very satisfactorily," Mr. Sim says.</seg>
<seg id="20">Within about six months, "things will be moving in the right direction," he predicts.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he's now in the driver's seat.</seg>
<seg id="22">When he came to Applied, "I didn't have the power to execute as I do today," he says.</seg>
<seg id="23">He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November.</seg>
<seg id="24">At Applied, Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective.</seg>
<seg id="25">He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $12.6 million, which helped launch the company's acquisition program.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sales climbed to an estimated $245 million in fiscal 1989, ended Aug. 31, from $99.9 million in fiscal 1985.</seg>
<seg id="27">The company expects that earnings, which have marched steadily upward in recent years, reached about $20.8 million, or $1.58 a share, in the fiscal year just ended, up from $15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $3.9 million in 1985.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michelle Pfeiffer can't chew gum and sing at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2">But on the evidence of "The Fabulous Baker Boys," that may be the only thing she can't do, at least when she's acting in movies.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the tough, slinky lounge chanteuse in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself, and more than passably well.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do, like she's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she's concentrating on matching that internal tone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music.</seg>
<seg id="6">When she isn't performing for an audience, she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth, and indicates that she's finished by sticking the gum back in.</seg>
<seg id="7">Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie, Ms. Pfeiffer's Susie seems like someone you've seen before, in numerous show-biz stories (even her name, Susie Diamond, sounds like a character Marilyn Monroe must have played).</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet nothing about "Baker Boys," and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer, really is like something from the video vault.</seg>
<seg id="9">Steve Kloves, the young writer and director (he isn't yet 30), has only one produced picture to his credit; he wrote the screenplay for "Racing With the Moon," a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older, someone who doesn't dismiss dreams, but who also has enough experience to see his limits.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace; "Baker Boys" is both bluesy and funny.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched; for example, the way Susie wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of course, it doesn't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they're doing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Much of the picture's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's slyly seductive lens work.</seg>
<seg id="15">After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder, the late German director, and more recently with Martin Scorsese ("After Hours," "The Color of Money," "The Last Temptation of Christ"), Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Dave Grusin's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship ("Feelings" is a must) without condescension.</seg>
<seg id="17">Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heelsthe boys are pretty great, too.</seg>
<seg id="18">What seemed like a good idea, to cast the Bridges brothers (Jeff and Beau) as the Baker brothers, actually turned out to be a good idea.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who's tried to appear "natural" in front of a camera knows that it's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff.</seg>
<seg id="20">So it's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers isn't natural at all, that Jeff and Beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they've done for 15 years professionally, and twice as long as that for themselves: They're playing proficient piano, face-to-face, on twin pianos.</seg>
<seg id="22">They're small time in the small time-hotels (not the best ones) and restaurants in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="23">Yet they don't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act.</seg>
<seg id="24">They wear tuxedos most nights, unless circumstances (a regular gig at a "tropical" lounge, for example) require them to wear special costumes, like Hawaiian shirts.</seg>
<seg id="25">Plump Beau, looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face, plays the older brother, Frank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Frank plans the program, takes care of business, and approaches the work like any other job.</seg>
<seg id="27">He's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job.</seg>
<seg id="28">He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frank grovels a little for the bookers, probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation.</seg>
<seg id="30">On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Jeff Bridges is the younger brother, Jack, who fancies himself the rebellious artist; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs, who climbs down the fire escape.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet Jack's the one who can remember every dive they ever played, and when, and he dutifully shows up for work night after night (he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute).</seg>
<seg id="33">Looking leaner than he has in a while, the younger Mr. Bridges's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank, who's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated.</seg>
<seg id="34">He can live with little pleasures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments.</seg>
<seg id="36">These include Jennifer Tilly's audition to be the Baker Boys' girl singer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, "Hill Street Blues." Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the "Candy Man," which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that couldn't be more perfect. (It matches her voice.) And Ms. Pfeiffer's particular version of "Making Whoopee" -- and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't gone and become a star in her own right.</seg>
<seg id="38">VIDEO TIP: If you'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen, and you have a lot of patience, take a look at "Grease 2." You'll find her there.</seg>
<seg id="39">Better yet, check out the emergence of her comic persona in "Married to the Mob," Jonathan Demme's delightful Mafia comedy.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Feeding Frenzy" (Henry Holt, 326 pages, $19.95), a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal, begins on a reassuring note.</seg>
<seg id="2">Right up front in the preface, co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity.</seg>
<seg id="3">When offered a free trip from the Bronx, Wedtech's home, to Washington, D.C., by one of Wedtech's principals, he tells the reader, "mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about, I declined."</seg>
<seg id="4">Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive, high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bribe by bribe, Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech's creation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although started in 1965, Wedtech didn't really get rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government's Section 8(A) minority business program.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="10">The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Instead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races.</seg>
<seg id="12">Besides being a "minority-owned company" Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="13">The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s.</seg>
<seg id="14">Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wedtech didn't just use old fashioned bribery.</seg>
<seg id="16">It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.</seg>
<seg id="17">When necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company.</seg>
<seg id="19">Wedtech management used the merit system.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you were not an effective crook, you found yourself out in the cold, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm's semiliterate "minority" person.</seg>
<seg id="22">But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy-to-read tabloid writing style, "Feeding Frenzy" often falls short of gripping reading.</seg>
<seg id="23">None of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.</seg>
<seg id="24">Wedtech's scammers simply bribed them to shut up.</seg>
<seg id="25">The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.</seg>
<seg id="27">The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="28">He enters the story toward the end, just in time to get arrested.</seg>
<seg id="29">Absorbed in doling out "Feeding Frenzy's" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8(A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.</seg>
<seg id="30">They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end "rigid affirmative action programs." Programs like Section 8(A) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up.</seg>
<seg id="31">Numerous other scandals, among them the ones at HUD, have the same characteristics as Wedtech.</seg>
<seg id="32">They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why are programs like this not eliminated? "Feeding Frenzy" does provide a few clues.</seg>
<seg id="34">In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.</seg>
<seg id="35">They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.</seg>
<seg id="36">They are our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.</seg>
<seg id="37">How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?</seg>
<seg id="38">This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A few years ago, I was on a panel of journalists that discussed the "image" of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others.</seg>
<seg id="2">We scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports richly earned, but also that it could be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="3">Competition could be maintained -- and stadiums probably would remain full -- if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students, we said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Comments from the audience reflected widespread, if wistful, agreement with those conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the session broke up, I was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university. "I'd love to see sports cut back, and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools, but everybody's afraid to make the first move," he confided. "It's like the U.S. and the Russians: Nobody wants to disarm first."</seg>
<seg id="6">And so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court, while the casualties mount.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college-sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are: "A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU" (Macmillan, 221 pages, $18.95) by David Whitford; "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" (Contemporary, 231 pages, $17.95) by Armen Keteyian; and "Never Too Young to Die: The Death of Len Bias" (Pantheon, 252 pages, $18.95) by Lewis Cole.</seg>
<seg id="9">The pick of the group is "Payroll"; it should be required reading for every college president.</seg>
<seg id="10">It chronicles how, over a period of a dozen years, Southern Methodist University bought its way to football respectability in the Southwest Conference, only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete-payoff system it created.</seg>
<seg id="11">The school was the first, in 1987, to receive the NCAA's "death penalty" -- two years without football -- for repeated rules violations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Given current headlines about the University of Florida, it may not be the last.</seg>
<seg id="13">The man who brought the bribe to the Dallas school was Ron Meyer, a flashy sort who came in 1975 to rescue a woebegone program, Mr. Whitford writes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Meyer's personal style was illustrated by his pinning a $100 bill to a high-school bulletin board on which other coaches tacked their cards.</seg>
<seg id="15">One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $10 and $20 bills that prospects sang "Here Comes Santa Claus" when he approached.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paying players at SMU was no casual operation.</seg>
<seg id="17">It involved the athletics director, two different football coaching staffs, and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody, it seemed, but Donald Shields, the university's president.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields, having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to Bill Clements, then a university governor (and now the governor of Texas!) and oil man Edwin Cox, chairman of the board of trustees.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You stay out of it," author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying. "Go run the university." Which was about what Mr. Shields did, and quietly, until he resigned a few years later, pleading ill health, when the stuff hit the fan.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Whitford drew on voluminous news media coverage of the SMU scandal, and on a university internal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Keteyian had to do most of his own digging on University of Nebraska football, which is, to date, high and dry as far as the NCAA is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, he gets low grades as an investigative reporter, relying heavily on what Chicago's late mayor, Richard J. Daley, called "insinuendo."</seg>
<seg id="23">Discrepancies go unexplained in "Confidential" (one ex-player claims he received $4,000 to $5,000 for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars), and when Mr. Keteyian can't nail down something, like who really owned a car driven by Husker tailback Doug Dubose, he simply reprints his notes.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between Husker players and a low-level female university employee.</seg>
<seg id="25">A serious charge -- that star flanker Irving Fryar "threw" the 1984 Orange Bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone -- is included, even though the Nebraska assistant coach quoted denied making it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still, the book produces more smoke than a smoldering sofa, along with a few flames, especially concerning the use of steroids.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dean Steinkuhler, a spectacularly bulked-up former lineman, confesses that he used 'em, and says other Huskers did too.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of Nebraska coaches.</seg>
<seg id="29">Probably, it didn't.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Never Too Young" is a different sort of work, focusing on the 1986 death from cocaine ingestion of Bias, a University of Maryland basketball star ticketed for sure pro stardom.</seg>
<seg id="31">While the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student, it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="32">Bias's coach, Lefty Driesell, ordered the room in which Bias died to be cleaned before the police could arrive (the order wasn't carried out), and the school's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players.</seg>
<seg id="33">Those, of course, were the responses of people with something to hide.</seg>
<seg id="34">One wonders how other college athletic officials would behave under the same circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tomorrow's "On Sports" column will look at another aspect of the college sports mess.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ducks.</seg>
<seg id="2">If the White House spots one, it intends to fire a veto at it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ducks are this season's word for new taxes, under OMB Director Richard Darman's formulation that "if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." George Bush is quite clear: No new ducks.</seg>
<seg id="4">But what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over Washington?</seg>
<seg id="5">We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Federal child care (quack).</seg>
<seg id="7">The Clean Air bill (quack).</seg>
<seg id="8">The disabled-workers bill (quack, quack).</seg>
<seg id="9">The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did: It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled, better child care.</seg>
<seg id="10">It comes up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly, wondering where all the "unexpected" costs came from.</seg>
<seg id="12">Consider, for instance, the very fat fowl known as federalized child care.</seg>
<seg id="13">The President came up with a good bill, but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions, answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services.</seg>
<seg id="15">They'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day, and they'd regulate the storage facilities.</seg>
<seg id="16">The initial costs are said to be in the $2 billion a year range, but that's only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="17">New entitlements tend to grow, creating a rationale for new taxes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quack.</seg>
<seg id="19">The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $14 billion and $19 billion annually, but economist Michael Evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $60 billion a year range.</seg>
<seg id="20">The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants.</seg>
<seg id="22">So instead of building more efficient modern plants, utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants.</seg>
<seg id="23">The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new, cleaner technology.</seg>
<seg id="24">The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide, as if a car registered in Big Sky, Montana, needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $500 per car.</seg>
<seg id="26">Other analysts say that estimate is low.</seg>
<seg id="27">Quack.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With Disabilities Act will cost, because nobody knows what the bill entails.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation.</seg>
<seg id="30">Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lawyers will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="32">Private companies, and ultimately their customers, will end up footing the huge bill.</seg>
<seg id="33">The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions.</seg>
<seg id="34">All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists, some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people, states and local governments.</seg>
<seg id="35">Running for President in 1980 and 1988, George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, during last year's campaign, the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business," the vice president declared when he was head of the task force.</seg>
<seg id="38">But with the impending passage of these new programs, Mr. Bush will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back.</seg>
<seg id="39">By 1986, the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then it turned up, and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year.</seg>
<seg id="41">Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the Bush presidency.</seg>
<seg id="42">We would have thought by now, though, that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation isn't the only way to slow down an economy.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is merely the most obvious.</seg>
<seg id="44">What is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire.</seg>
<seg id="45">But while they are unloading these burdens, the United States is close to creating three more big ones.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks.</seg>

<seg id="1">(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)</seg>
<seg id="2">Thomas Jefferson sold Congress on the idea of the decimal system for currency, thus saving Americans the headaches of pounds, shillings and pence.</seg>
<seg id="3">But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the French had invented.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead, Congress opted for the inches, feet and yards the colonists had brought with them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Americans didn't dislike metrics; they simply ignored them.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scientists felt differently.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 1807, the Swiss mathematician who headed the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made an "iron meter" that he had brought from Europe the standard of measure.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the century scientists had embraced the system.</seg>
<seg id="9">Businessmen took their cue from the engineers.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Congress finally passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1975, industry was far ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the law made compliance voluntary, it inspired little more than jokes. (The press had a field day with questions about what would happen to "six-footer," "yardstick" and "inchworm.")</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, though the public is barely aware, much of U.S. industry, particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas, have made metrics routine.</seg>
<seg id="13">General Motors, for example, uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power trains. (In auto advertising, however, items such as wheelbases are still described in inches.) Farm-machine makers such as Caterpillar and Deere work in the metric system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The liquor industry went metric 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Pentagon has led the charge, particularly as military alliances spread world-wide.</seg>
<seg id="16">New weapons systems will be around until the next century, notes John Tascher, the Defense Department's metric coordinator.</seg>
<seg id="17">Still, like the auto makers, when dealing with Mr. Everyman the Pentagon sticks to the tried and true.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soldiers and sailors are still measured in inches and pounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2">It Didn't Go Well</seg>
<seg id="3">Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="5">"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They bullied me backstage.</seg>
<seg id="12">They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">They bullied me!</seg>
<seg id="14">And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.</seg>
<seg id="15">West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?</seg>
<seg id="16">Try love."</seg>
<seg id="17">His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."</seg>
<seg id="18">West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="19">West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.</seg>
<seg id="20">West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."</seg>
<seg id="21">But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="22">"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is free.</seg>
<seg id="24">So are we," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination.</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision, he went to a "company court" for a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the scheduled time, Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the three members of the court introduced themselves, the chairman of the panel said: "Go ahead and tell us what happened.</seg>
<seg id="6">We may ask questions as you go along, or we may wait until the end."</seg>
<seg id="7">No lawyers or tape recorders were present.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists, one of whom knew Mr. Stone's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over a cup of coffee, Mr. Stone told his story.</seg>
<seg id="10">He talked about 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="11">When he was through, the court members asked many questions, then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager's side and talk to witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bob Stone is a fictional name, but the incident described is real.</seg>
<seg id="14">It happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The court is called the Management Appeals Committee, or just "MAC," and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year.</seg>
<seg id="16">Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis, the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis, a General Electric plant in Columbia, Md., or a number of other companies.</seg>
<seg id="17">These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world: the rise of what I call corporate due process.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons.</seg>
<seg id="21">It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees, with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations.</seg>
<seg id="22">It helps to keep out unions.</seg>
<seg id="23">It increases employee commitment to the company, with all that means for efficiency and quality control.</seg>
<seg id="24">What must your management team do to establish corporate due process?</seg>
<seg id="25">Here are four key steps:</seg>
<seg id="26">1.</seg>
<seg id="27">Make sure you have a strong personnel department.</seg>
<seg id="28">It must be able to handle most of the complaints that cannot be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates, else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases.</seg>
<seg id="29">At Polaroid, the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages.</seg>
<seg id="30">At TWA, the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year, only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists.</seg>
<seg id="31">At Citicorp, the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel's skill in complaint-resolution.</seg>
<seg id="32">In a typical year, up to 20% of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment.</seg>
<seg id="33">In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle.</seg>
<seg id="34">2.</seg>
<seg id="35">Formally or informally, train all your managers and supervisors in the company's due-process approach.</seg>
<seg id="36">See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards, for it is the "law" governing company courts and adjudicators.</seg>
<seg id="37">Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately.</seg>
<seg id="38">In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator, teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life, for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the 15 companies I studied, reversal rates range on the average from 20% to 40%.</seg>
<seg id="40">3.</seg>
<seg id="41">Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator.</seg>
<seg id="42">A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and, for the panelists, mutual support.</seg>
<seg id="43">An adjudicator system -- that is, an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed, flexibility and maximum privacy.</seg>
<seg id="44">International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach.</seg>
<seg id="45">4.</seg>
<seg id="46">Make your due-process system visible.</seg>
<seg id="47">It won't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it.</seg>
<seg id="48">Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints.</seg>
<seg id="49">On the other hand, they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs.</seg>
<seg id="51">Naturally, one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it.</seg>
<seg id="52">At IBM, the company's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="53">Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale, chief executive and chief operating officer, respectively, sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases.</seg>
<seg id="54">Mr. Ewing is a consultant based in Winchester, Mass., and author of "Justice on the Job: Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace" (Harvard Business School Press, 1989).</seg>

<seg id="1">"Hacksaw" and "Bonecrusher" are the sort of nicknames normally associated with linebackers and heavyweight contenders.</seg>
<seg id="2">Who'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents?</seg>
<seg id="3">Chicago's new school chief is the hard-nosed Ted Kimbrough.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his old job in Compton, Calif., he took a bitter teachers' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member.</seg>
<seg id="5">At his first Chicago press conference, he berated the reporters.</seg>
<seg id="6">In New York City, the new Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both men fit the mood of the times -- the mood being one of a public fed up with officials' rationalizations for why their schools don't work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Patterson, N.J., principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject of the movie "Lean on Me," Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat.</seg>
<seg id="10">He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline, but isn't it interesting that some of the country's biggest, most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold?</seg>
<seg id="11">Elena Scambio, the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state, says her top priority will be to "cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy."</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Fernandez doesn't take control in New York until January, but already he's roiling the waters.</seg>
<seg id="13">He's attacked the concept of "building tenure," one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools.</seg>
<seg id="14">It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals.</seg>
<seg id="15">Once they are in the building, they stay.</seg>
<seg id="16">One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years, despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack.</seg>
<seg id="18">Naturally, the principals' union loves building tenure, and tenure has withstood previous challenge.</seg>
<seg id="19">We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal, toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they're defending.</seg>
<seg id="20">In his old job, as Dade County chief, Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals.</seg>
<seg id="21">He cut the dropout rate by 5.5%.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well; incompetent principals and administrators should go, but the good ones ought to be left alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">The situation will be especially delicate for Mr. Kimbrough.</seg>
<seg id="24">He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform.</seg>
<seg id="25">Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards, one for each school.</seg>
<seg id="26">This of course led to disaster in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="27">Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential, but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems.</seg>
<seg id="29">The schools' central mission, educating children, became subsumed by the competing interests of bureaucrats, politicians and unions.</seg>
<seg id="30">The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system, discipline collapsed, and kids stopped learning.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Chips was a nice fellow, and maybe some day he'll return.</seg>
<seg id="32">Until then, it's clear that some of the people who've been keeping big-city schools down are going to be dealing with the Terminator.</seg>

<seg id="4">Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'</seg>
<seg id="8">Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.</seg>
<seg id="9">He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?</seg>
<seg id="10">What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?</seg>
<seg id="12">Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'</seg>
<seg id="13">In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.</seg>
<seg id="14">From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.</seg>
<seg id="15">The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.</seg>
<seg id="16">'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.</seg>
<seg id="18">The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.</seg>

<seg id="2">China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.</seg>
<seg id="6">Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.</seg>
<seg id="8">Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.</seg>
<seg id="10">Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1">Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'</seg>
<seg id="2">U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.</seg>
<seg id="6">The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="8">Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."</seg>
<seg id="12">Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="15">When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They must not be defiant.</seg>
<seg id="17">They must not question the motives of the accuser.</seg>
<seg id="18">They must be calm and serene."</seg>
<seg id="19">Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Big if true," he tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="22">In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."</seg>

<seg id="1">Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof</seg>
<seg id="2">It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.</seg>
<seg id="3">Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?</seg>
<seg id="4">At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="6">He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.</seg>
<seg id="8">I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="10">The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.</seg>
<seg id="11">The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.</seg>
<seg id="12">A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.</seg>
<seg id="16">English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.</seg>
<seg id="20">English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.</seg>
<seg id="21">All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pretty moderate stuff.</seg>
<seg id="23">And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?</seg>

<seg id="1">Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days</seg>
<seg id="2">Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.</seg>
<seg id="3">The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.</seg>
<seg id="4">It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'</seg>
<seg id="9">The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOINT FINAL REPORT on the Results of Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration in the Slovak Republic and in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Joint Report of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="3">May 2017</seg>
<seg id="4">Supreme Audit Office, Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="6">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="7">This joint report provides information about the course and outcome of international cooperation on parallel audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (“Slovak SAO”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (“Czech SAO”) in the field of excise duty administration in 2012-2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of both countries was carried out based on an agreement on cooperation on parallel audits of excise duty administration concluded between them in August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The topic of the parallel audits was chosen because both EU Member States follow common European legislation on this matter, thereby providing an opportunity to ascertain how European legislation is applied on a national level, how the excise duty administration system is set up, and how the system in Slovakia and the system in the Czech Republic differ.</seg>
<seg id="10">The greatest benefits of these audits consisted in the exchange of experience, identification of differences and good practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last, but not least, finding out that international comparability of data on efficiency and effectiveness of excise duty administration is extremely limited without performing parallel audits was also beneficial.</seg>

<seg id="16">Supreme Audit Office Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="17">Supreme Audit Office Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="18">Results of Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration</seg>
<seg id="19">Summary and assessment</seg>
<seg id="20">Legislation in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia on excise duty and its administration complies with EU legislation and exceeds EU requirements substantially.</seg>
<seg id="21">Differences have been discovered between Slovak and Czech excise duty regulations: in the Czech Republic, verification of the economic stability of applicants for permits and mandatory labelling and dyeing of several mineral and some other oils contribute to effective excise duty administration; in Slovakia, the distribution of excise stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less of a burden on excise duty administrators.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the fight against excise duty evasion, supervising the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco materials, the implementation of the institute of a transport fuel distributor, and keeping a registry of merchants of consumer packaged alcohol appear to be a good practice in the fight against excise duty evasion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Excise duty revenues in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia grow more slowly than other tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="24">The objectives of the EU consisting in reducing labour taxation, introducing green measures, and reducing dependencies on tobacco and alcohol have not been yet implemented in the Czech Republic and Slovakia also because excise duty indexation has not been introduced in either country.</seg>
<seg id="25">This has resulted in the reduced importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, due to growing buying power, an actual drop in the tax burden in the form of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="26">In future, it will be necessary to replace the introduced green measures which the state subsidises and which have a negative impact on excise duty revenues by other revenues or by a reduction in public spending.</seg>
<seg id="27">Administrative expenditure on excise duty administration in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been rising long especially because of wage growth and the diminishing effectiveness of such spending.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Slovakia, such effectiveness is also negatively affected by the costs of computerisation of excise duty administration (IT expenditures) and the payroll costs of employees carrying out constant fiscal supervision in alcohol warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Computerisation of excise duty administration in Slovakia has not significantly affected the number of excise duty administrators.</seg>
<seg id="30">Both the Czech and the Slovak SAO recommend that the Slovak Tax Directorate reassesses the justification for constant fiscal supervision in alcohol warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditures is influenced by the fact that, in the audited period, the Czech Customs Administration did not apply procedures that would lead to a reduction in the staffing required for excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">In each of the audited years, the number of comparable administrative tasks performed by excise duty administrators in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic was similar; however, the number of comparable tax subjects in Slovakia is about one third smaller than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="33">Slovak excise duty administrators perform administrative tasks predominantly in the form of physical fiscal supervision, whereas Czech excise duty administrators place emphasis on remote supervision and risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="34">Excise duty administration in Slovakia is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and, with regard to the ratio of tax actions to entities, more expensive as well.</seg>
<seg id="35">Excise duty administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was computerised in different areas.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Slovakia, the administration of excise declarations is fully computerised; in the Czech Republic, documents proving taxation of various products in free circulation are submitted electronically.</seg>
<seg id="37">As both computerisation methods support effective excise duty administration, both the Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO recommend applying them outside these two countries as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">Total expenditures on implementing the Excise Movement and Control System (“EMCS”) could not be compared, as the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic only provided expenditure data pertaining to the system upgrade that took place between 2011 and 2015, although spending occurred even prior to this period.</seg>
<seg id="39">Expenditure in the mentioned period only on the EMCS upgrade was 20% higher than total spending in the Czech Republic on both implementing and upgrading of the EMCS over a period exceeding ten years.</seg>
<seg id="40">Excise duty administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not attain comparable qualitative indicator values in comparable spending.</seg>
<seg id="41">The level of supervision in both countries is comparable; in Slovakia, however, excise duty administration is much more demanding on resources.</seg>
<seg id="42">Implementation of a computerised system for the movement and surveillance of excisable products has resulted in more effective excise duty administration in both countries but less so in Slovakia, as Slovakia spent much more than the Czech Republic on implementing and modernising the system.</seg>
<seg id="43">Basic information</seg>
<seg id="44">Cooperation of both audit institutions was based on the “Agreement on Cooperation on Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration” dated 18 August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO agreed to conduct parallel audits aimed primarily at excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="46">The results of the audits would allow analysis, comparison, and assessment of the findings.</seg>
<seg id="47">The audit questions on which the parallel audits were based were agreed jointly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Characteristics of the subject and objectives of the parallel audits: The parallel audits aimed to compare the performance of the excise duty administrators while taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators and identifying weaknesses in the excise duty administration process.</seg>
<seg id="49">Answers to the following audit questions in particular should have been sought:</seg>
<seg id="50">Have excise duty administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia been attaining comparable values of qualitative indicators while incurring comparable costs?</seg>
<seg id="51">Has implementation of the EMCS resulted in more effective excise duty administration and has been spending on its implementation effective?</seg>
<seg id="52">The parallel audits should have ascertained the reasons for the differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of excise duty administration in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, especially in the area of legislation and in the setup of the organisational structure.</seg>
<seg id="53">The joint final report on the audit results was drawn up in accordance with ISSAI 300 - Fundamental Principles of Performance Auditing.</seg>
<seg id="54">The General Directorate of Customs (“GDC”) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (“FD SR”) have joined the joint declaration on mutual cooperation of the Visegrad Four countries, the aim of which - in the area of excise duty - is to fight fraud, examine the possibility of harmonising legal regulations and finding harmonised interpretations of rules of various problems, examine the possibility of joint activities to increase the effectiveness of efforts to detect fraud, and share experience and best practice.</seg>
<seg id="55">1 EMCS is operated according to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="56">Identification of audit conducted by the Czech SAO</seg>
<seg id="57">Audit number: 15/33</seg>
<seg id="58">Subject of audit: Excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="59">Audit objective: The objective of the Czech SAO audit was to examine the procedure used by the customs authorities in excise duty administration, especially when monitoring movement of goods under excise duty suspension and when enforcing duties (customs debt), and to examine whether the excise duty administration system has been set up to ensure the effective collection of state budget revenue.</seg>
<seg id="60">Audited period: 2012-2015 and, if the facts so warrant, the periods before and after</seg>
<seg id="61">Auditee: General Directorate of Customs</seg>
<seg id="62">Identification of audit conducted by the Slovak SAO</seg>
<seg id="63">Audit number: KA-023/2016/1050</seg>
<seg id="64">Subject of audit: Excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="65">Audit objective: The objective of the audit was independent and objective examination of whether the FD SR and the customs offices operate economically, effectively, efficiently, and in compliance with generally binding legal regulations as regards excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="66">Audited period: 2012-2015</seg>
<seg id="67">Auditee: Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="68">Excise duty legislation in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="69">Legislation on excise duty administration can be divided into two levels:</seg>
<seg id="70">EU legislation (see Annex 1) and national legislation (see Annex 2). Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for excise duty administration and the handling of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, ethyl alcohol, and alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="71">This directive allows excise duties to be imposed on other products as well.</seg>
<seg id="72">EU legislation regulates especially the minimum conditions for the following: Excise duty rates on specific products; Criteria for production, storage, processing, and holding excisable products; Establishment of the excise duty obligation; Excise duty exemption and refund; and Supervision over movement of various goods between EU Member States, international cooperation, and maintenance of a registry of economic entities and tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="73">EU legislation allows the implementation of control procedures and institutions on the national level, provided that these do not lead to a distortion of competition.</seg>
<seg id="74">Excise duty legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="75">Specification of legislation in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="76">In the Czech Republic, excise duty provisions are concentrated in the Excise Duty Act (Act No 353/2003 Coll.), which governs the administration of duty on mineral oil, duty on ethyl alcohol, duty on tobacco products, duty on beer, duty on wine and intermediate products, and duty on raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="77">This act defines the forms of handling excisable products, duty payers, authorisation proceedings, conditions for moving products, excise declarations and penalties for violating legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="78">This act and the related decrees further regulate certain other conditions for handling mineral oils (marking mineral oils) and storing raw tobacco for purposes other than production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="79">Duties on other energy products (i.e., natural gas and some other gases, solid fuels, and electricity) are regulated in Parts 45-47 of Act No 261/2007 Coll., on stabilisation of public budgets.</seg>
<seg id="80">In the Czech Republic, some special legal regulations contain several provisions related to excise duty administration, specifically the Fuels Act (Act No 311/2006 Coll.) and implementing regulations governing the conditions for selling, dispensing, and distributing fuel and keeping records of fuel placed in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="81">Act No 61/1997 Coll., on ethyl alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for producing, storing, recording, and controlling the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="82">Act No 307/2013 Coll., on mandatory labelling of spirits, and the related implementing regulations set out the mandatory labelling of consumer packaged alcohol, the conditions for using alcohol excise stamps, and the conditions for handling ethyl alcohol (i.e., production, processing, sale or other transfer, carriage, movement, storage, receipt, use, holding, import, or export).</seg>
<seg id="83">The procedures in duty proceedings that are not set out in special regulations are regulated by Act No 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.</seg>
<seg id="84">Penalties are imposed according to Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Code of Administrative Procedure.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conditions for issuing trade licences (concessions) for carrying out the business of “production and processing of fuel and lubricants and distribution of fuels” and “production, modification, and sale of fermented ethyl alcohol, potable ethyl alcohol, and alcoholic beverages” are regulated by Act No 455/1991 Coll., on trades (the Trade Licensing Act).</seg>
<seg id="86">The Czech Republic made use of its right to introduce control procedures and concepts for checking the movement of specific products placed in free circulation and overseeing the observance of legal regulations on handling various products on which excise duty has not been paid and on handling various products on which excise duty has been paid.</seg>
<seg id="87">This applies to the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, marking certain other mineral oils, and labelling tobacco products and consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Czech Republic made use of its rights to impose excise duty on other products as well and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="89">Structure of amendments to legislation on each type of excise duty in relation to the subject of the audit in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="90">Based on Resolution No 735/2012 of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 implementing the “plan for zero tolerance of the alcohol black market”, fundamental legislative changes took place in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015 leading to the implementation of measures against excise duty fraud on ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="91">In the same period, several amendments were made to legislation regulating duty on mineral oil, duty on tobacco products, and the criminal offence of planning tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="92">Criminal law protection of taxable revenues</seg>
<seg id="93">Effective since 1 July 2016, planning “evasion of taxes, fees, and similar mandatory payments” has become a criminal offence, making it easier for the police to adopt measures in a more effective and timely manner to prevent tax fraud by, for example, deploying criminal intelligence operations.</seg>
<seg id="94">General provisions on excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="95">The issuance of authorisations (licences) to handle excisable products pursuant to the Excise Tax Act is, effective since 1 January 2015, conditional upon satisfaction of the following: Credibility; Debt-free status; Economic stability; Possession of a trade licence allowing activities related to the authorisation; and Fact that the applicant is not in liquidation or in bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="96">The aim of the legislation was to address tax arrears by reducing the number of entities with authorisation to handle excisable products.</seg>
<seg id="97">The condition of economic stability now allows an excise duty administrator to consider the financial situation of tax entities both during the authorisation proceedings and after the authorisation is issued.</seg>
<seg id="98">The purpose of this measure is to bar subjects without sufficient income that would allow them to duly satisfy duty obligations from handling certain products.</seg>
<seg id="99">To assess the economic stability of applicants, several indicators have been laid down (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, and productivity of labour), based on which a financial analysis is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="100">In addition to these indicators, the final decision is also based on the excise duty administrator’s judgment with regard to the specific conditions of the respective proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="101">The law sets out the frequency for checking the fulfilment of the conditions of economic stability based on current conditions as once a year in connection with the submission of the tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="102">The excise duty administrator can stipulate other conditions required for duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="103">If the authorisation holder is no longer fulfilling the conditions, the excise duty administrator is authorised to cancel or suspend the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="104">Out of a total of 2,609 entities examined for economic stability by the Czech Customs Administration, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears should the obligation to declare and pay tax exceed the amount of the tax guarantee (e.g., recurring consignee).</seg>
<seg id="105">The authorisation of ten entities was cancelled; other applicants increased the amount of the tax guarantees, capitalised their contribution in their company, or submitted current data from their bookkeeping to show they satisfied all the conditions for receiving authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="106">The conditions of credibility and debt-free status must also be satisfied by an individual (natural person) who is a governing body or a member of such body or by an individual who may not be the applicant’s governing body or member of such body but is carrying out this activity (chaining of legal entities in the position of governing body or member, so-called linked entities).</seg>
<seg id="107">By the end of 2016, there were scrutinized more than 30,000 linked entities.</seg>
<seg id="108">Records kept pursuant to the Excise Duty Act (Sections 37-40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) must contain the following data:</seg>
<seg id="109">Type, name, code and amount of goods produced, received, issued or dispatched, categorised according to type of duty arrangement (duty suspension, import, placement back under duty suspension, export, free circulation, own consumption, loss);</seg>
<seg id="110">Identifier (SEED ID) of consignee or consignor of various goods, declarant, event date, and date of entry in the records;</seg>
<seg id="111">Movement of various goods (e.g., means of transport, carrier, transport number)</seg>
<seg id="112">Registration numbers of related documents; and</seg>
<seg id="113">Notification of placement of consumer packaged alcohol bearing an excise stamp into free circulation and data on its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="114">A record of receipt must be drawn up immediately once transport ends.</seg>
<seg id="115">Electronic recordkeeping has to be maintained in xls, xlsx or ods format, or it has to be possible to convert output into such format.</seg>
<seg id="116">Ethyl Alcohol</seg>
<seg id="117">After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced comprehensive measures consisting in a detailed overview of the operations of entities (see Annex 3, Diagram A), from production of raw ethyl alcohol and labelling with alcohol excise stamps to distribution to the final merchants or authorised users of duty-exempt ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In the Czech Republic, alcohol facilities not in operation are also subject to supervision by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="119">The aim of the new legislation was to improve the overview of ethyl alcohol processing and ethyl alcohol production, identify the persons handling consumer packaged alcohol, limit the handling of ethyl alcohol to financially stable and credible persons and ensure constant supervision over the production and labelling of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="120">The most important measures are as follows: Ethyl alcohol production, receipt, storage, and dispatch records contain information about the amount of ethyl alcohol in each stage of production and processing with document numbers indicated.</seg>
<seg id="121">Restrictions on package volume, material of consumer packaged goods, and on the number of packages with a damaged excise stamp at the point of final sale or dispatch to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="122">Consumer packaging means a container or other package holding a maximum of one litre or, if a container is made of glass, three litres.</seg>
<seg id="123">Ethyl alcohol in bigger packaging is considered as being unmarked and may not be handled.</seg>
<seg id="124">At the point of final sale to individuals for consumption, there can only be one consumer packaged item with a damaged excise stamp or, if the packaging is equipped with a one-way valve, three consumer packaged items with a damaged excise stamp.</seg>
<seg id="125">Mandatory registration of persons who place consumer packaged alcohol with at least 15% ethyl alcohol per volume into free circulation and who are ethyl alcohol importers or producers in the Czech Republic or operators of warehouses under duty suspension, provided personal and technical conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="126">The personal conditions of credibility, integrity, and no record of being banned from doing business have to be met by the applicant and the person acting in the capacity of the statutory body or a responsible person.</seg>
<seg id="127">Depending on the number of alcohol excise stamps ordered, the applicant has to pay a guarantee of CZK 100,000-5,000,000 (i.e., approx. EUR 3,700-185,000).</seg>
<seg id="128">The technical conditions for registration include suitability of the alcohol labelling site and a camera security system that is located in the labelling facilities or warehouse, operates continuously and allows remote access to the duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="129">Registration markings of the excise stamp are used for labelling alcohol with a volume greater than 0.06 litres.</seg>
<seg id="130">During movement of the alcohol excise stamps, the registration markings of the alcohol excise stamps must be indicated in the transport documents or, in the case of export, in the customs declaration.</seg>
<seg id="131">Until 30 November 2013, alcohol excise stamps contained a 10-digit registration code that included a 4-digit offtake registration number, excise stamp application code, and ethanol concentration level classification code.</seg>
<seg id="132">Effective of 1 December 2013, excise stamps contain two types of identifiers and the amount of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaged alcohol expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20°C, rounded down to whole millilitres.</seg>
<seg id="133">[Registration Code, which is a 12-digit alphanumeric code - 1st to 4th position – registration offtake code of the person obliged to label alcohol - 5th to 8th position – information expressing the date of the excise stamp order - 9th to 12th position – information identical to the information allowing determination of the excise tax base Special 8-digit alphanumeric code comprising a unique, unrepeatable code allocated to only one excise stamp Electronically readable version of the special code allowing verification of the code on the excise stamp Source: Decree No 334/2013 of 17 October 2013] The alcohol excise stamp record contains daily entries on the ways in which the alcohol excise stamps are used according to the registration codes, as well as the documents that the entries are based on.</seg>
<seg id="134">In case of destruction, loss, or theft of specific alcohol excise stamps, the holder is obliged to inform the excise duty administrator electronically on the next business day following the decisive event about the registration codes of the relevant alcohol excise stamps and the number of stamps in question.</seg>
<seg id="135">Introduction of new offences and adjustment of the amounts of penalties imposed in case of a breach of legal regulations in connection with handling alcohol excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="136">Penalties may be imposed up to the amount of the excise duty or even exceed such amount ten times (e.g., in case of damage or loss of alcohol excise stamps exceeding 0.1% of the total amount of each executed order of alcohol excise stamps or in case of failure to return alcohol excise stamps by the statutory deadline).</seg>
<seg id="137">Restrictions on handling alcohol excise stamps to allow only registered holders to do so. They may not assign the stamps to other persons except foreign suppliers for the purpose of labelling consumer packaged alcohol manufactured outside the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="138">Exported alcohol excise stamps have to be affixed to the consumer packaging and imported back within nine months of when the stamps were received from the duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mandatory registration of distributors of consumer packaged alcohol under the condition of satisfaction of similar conditions as in the case of a person obliged to label alcohol, with an obligation to pay a guarantee of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 185,000).</seg>
<seg id="140">Specification of persons allowed to sell or purchase consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="141">Authorised persons are obliged to sell consumer packaged alcohol to other registered persons, to final sellers, or they can sell it as final sellers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="142">They may purchase alcohol from other registered persons, liquidators (insolvency administrators, receivers), administrative authorities, government establishments, or unregistered persons in connection with tax execution procedure.</seg>
<seg id="143">Holders and distributors of alcohol are obliged to send notifications of placement of alcohol into free circulation or of the sale of consumer packaged alcohol in free circulation on the day immediately following the day after the decisive event to the duty administrator through the information system operated by the duty administrator (ORO WebKlient) or, upon observing content requirements, in xml format.</seg>
<seg id="144">The notification contains the number of alcohol excise stamps used and the type of consumer packaging, percentage volume of ethyl alcohol, European Article Number (EAN), identification of distributor or final seller and the name of the product and production batch number.</seg>
<seg id="145">Between 2014 and 2015, tax entities sent approx. 10.5 million notifications.</seg>
<seg id="146">Mandatory concession (specific form of trade licence) not only for ethyl alcohol production and treatment, but also for the sale of consumer packaged alcohol by a business operator to individuals for their personal consumption or to other legal entities or entrepreneurs for their own internal needs.</seg>
<seg id="147">A concession can only be run following the issuance of a decision by the trade licencing office and upon fulfilling professional and other qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="148">The sale of ethyl alcohol does not require any prescribed professional qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="149">A benefit for the excise duty administrator is an overview of ethyl alcohol merchants and their operating premises and restriction of trading to credible entities.</seg>
<seg id="150">In the Czech Republic, approx.</seg>
<seg id="151">94,000 concessions were registered in 2014 and 104,000 in 2015 for the field that includes production, treatment, and sale of fermented ethyl alcohol, potable ethyl alcohol, spirits, and other alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="152">Other than the excise duty administrator, the following authorities can also conduct checks of the observance of legal regulations in connection with the handling of excisable products in the Czech Republic: Trade licensing offices; Czech Agriculture and Food Inspection Authority; Bodies of the Czech Financial Administration; Bodies of the Czech Trade Inspection.</seg>
<seg id="153">The excise duty administrator is informed immediately if a breach of obligations or violation of a ban is discovered.</seg>
<seg id="154">Mineral oils</seg>
<seg id="155">The Czech Republic has in place a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Diagram B) of excisable mineral oils and certain non-excisable mineral oils that have been misused for tax evasion purposes.</seg>
<seg id="156">The system includes the supervision of activities ranging from the production, storage, movement, marking, and dyeing of various mineral oils and marking certain other mineral oils, to the delivery of mineral oils to end consumers or users and, in certain cases, even the consumption of mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="157">The supervision undertaken by customs authorities also includes production and handling of marking substances for marking mineral oils.</seg>
<seg id="158">Mineral oils listed under combined nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (Other kerosene), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not listed elsewhere) and 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45, and 2710 19 49 (heavy gas oils) are subject to marking and dyeing, provided that marking is not prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other mineral oils, such as benzol, toluol, xylol and lubricating oils, and other oils intended for uses other than engine propulsion are subject to marking.</seg>
<seg id="160">Marking and dyeing various mineral oils and certain other mineral oils using a marking substance is possible only if permitted by the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="161">2 Apart from beer, fruit wine, other wine and mead and fruit brandies obtained from distillation. 3 Council Regulation (EEC)</seg>
<seg id="162">No 2658/87 dated 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff. 4 For example, in connection with use of mineral oils as fuel (save for boating if not private recreational boats) or as a component for the production of fuel if marking impairs use.</seg>
<seg id="163">The most important new measures implemented since 2012:</seg>
<seg id="164">Monitoring the handling of special mineral oils, which is the group of mineral oils found under combined nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e., lubricating oils and other oils intended for uses other than engine propulsion) with a viscosity at 40°C that is less than 12 mm2/s-1, inclusive, and which have at least one of the following specifications: Flash point is lower than 150°C or During distillation, it is redistilled less than 20% of volume, including losses, at 350°C.</seg>
<seg id="165">These mineral oils have been misused to adulterate final fuels, especially diesel, or have been used directly or sold as motor fuel, as the physical properties are very similar.</seg>
<seg id="166">Entities handling monitored mineral oils either in bulk storage or in packaging exceeding 220 litres must be registered with the duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="167">For the registration to be issued, the applicant, the governing body, and the responsible representative have to meet the stipulated personal conditions, and these have to be satisfied for the duration of the registration.</seg>
<seg id="168">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="169">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="170">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="171">As at 30 November 2016, the registry of persons authorised to handle mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations; four registrations were cancelled on the request of the registration holders themselves.</seg>
<seg id="172">Electronic records have to contain detailed information about income, own consumption, and sale or movement of mineral oils, including document numbers, numbers of the notifications of receipt sent to the excise duty administrator, storage and consumption sites, purpose of consumption, or, in the case of sale, place of delivery (destination) and customer registration number.</seg>
<seg id="173">The excise duty administrator has to receive notifications of each receipt of special mineral oils 24 to 72 hours prior to the receipt.</seg>
<seg id="174">The notification must include identification of the business partners, name and nomenclature of each special mineral oil, amount, purpose of consumption or sale/transfer information.</seg>
<seg id="175">Notification of the expected amount of mineral oil to be purchased, sold or consumed in the respective year must be submitted by the entity at the time of submission of the registration application or by the end of the respective calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="176">Notifications of the purpose of use and marking, storage, or consumption site, and identification data about the person to whom the special mineral oil is sold or transferred are to be submitted before each change of such information.</seg>
<seg id="177">Notifications are submitted electronically using intelligent forms or via data box in PDF format.</seg>
<seg id="178">A total of 630 notifications were submitted by persons handling special mineral oils during the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="179">An excise duty administrator has to confiscate and forfeit special mineral oils or the transport vehicle when he discovers that special mineral oils are being handled without registration or if the registered person is not fulfilling his notification obligations.</seg>
<seg id="180">Just like the case of failure to fulfil obligations connected to the transport/movement of excisable goods, these shortcomings cannot be remedied after the fact.</seg>
<seg id="181">Fuel distributor registration is mandatory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.</seg>
<seg id="182">Only persons who fulfil the following criteria can be registered distributors: ശശ Mandatory concession from the Trade Licensing Office (specific form of trade licence).</seg>
<seg id="183">The customs office provides an opinion on the concession application or on the appointment of a responsible representative.</seg>
<seg id="184">It examines whether the concession applicant or the governing body or members of the governing body of the applicant/legal entity and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of credibility.</seg>
<seg id="185">If these persons satisfy the credibility condition, the customs office issues a positive standpoint.</seg>
<seg id="186">A credible person means a person with integrity, i.e., a person with no criminal record regarding propertyrelated, customs-related or tax-related offences.</seg>
<seg id="187">Possession of professional qualifications is also a condition for the issuance of a concession.</seg>
<seg id="188">Debt-free status of the same persons as in the case of credibility above.</seg>
<seg id="189">A person with debtfree status is a person who provides a sufficient guarantee that he will satisfy his payment obligations to the state duly and on time, i.e., he has no arrears with respect to the state budget or general health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="190">The fact that the fuel distributor was not disqualified, i.e., barred from carrying on his business activities, by a court or administrative authority.</seg>
<seg id="191">The fact that the fuel distributor is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="192">Payment of a guarantee (or provision of a bank deposit) in the amount of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 370,000) after being registered as a fuel distributor after three years and satisfying other conditions.</seg>
<seg id="193">A distributor is obliged to submit the fuel distribution notification within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="194">The electronic notification has to contain information about each purchase and sale of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="195">The reported data are data about business partners, document numbers, the specific product, amount, price, carrier, and means of transport, and loading and unloading site.</seg>
<seg id="196">The entitlement to a refund of duty on mineral oils used in primary agricultural production was re-introduced in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="197">The excise duty refund on mineral oils can only be claimed for those activities that clearly relate to activities carried out on land plots.</seg>
<seg id="198">In 2015, there were about 64,000 such excise duty refund claims, totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e., € 43,401,720).</seg>
<seg id="199">In 2017, the Czech Government also introduced an excise duty refund on fuel for farmers with livestock production.</seg>
<seg id="200">Farmers or breeders of cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep, and goats are now also entitled to apply for a refund.</seg>
<seg id="201">Tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="202">Restriction of the sale of tobacco products with an old VAT rate</seg>
<seg id="203">In response to the long-term failure to generate budgetary revenues from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic, effective of 1 December 2014, introduced a restriction on the sale of tobacco products with an old VAT rate should the VAT rate change.</seg>
<seg id="204">Excise duty on tobacco products is paid through tobacco excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="205">Use of tobacco excise stamps is understood as the affixation of stickers on a unit package (Section 116 of the Excise Duty Act).</seg>
<seg id="206">The production of tobacco products in a state intended for end users is decisive for the application of excise duty rates, even though their unloading, delivery, dispatch, sale, or sale to end users may not take place.</seg>
<seg id="207">The letter of the alphabet representing the excise duty rate is indicated on the tobacco excise stamp together with the price for the end user in the case of cigarettes, number of pieces in the package or amount of loose smoking tobacco in kilogrammes.</seg>
<seg id="208">A tobacco excise stamp has no identifier.</seg>
<seg id="209">The length of the interim period for the sale of unit packages of cigarettes intended for direct consumption, affixed with a tobacco stamp with the previous old tax rate, was specified as the elapse of the last day of the second calendar month following the effective date of the new excise duty rate.</seg>
<seg id="210">Developments in the offtake of tobacco stamps in 2014 and a comparison with developments in previous years suggest that each year, tobacco product manufacturers had substantially frontloaded tobacco products with the “old” tax rate, which led to the force of the “new” tax rate factually moving forward by about a year.</seg>
<seg id="211">Duty on raw tobacco</seg>
<seg id="212">Due to the risk of misuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without a licence from the excise duty administrator and due to the non-payment of excise duty, imposing a duty on raw tobacco and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco were measures introduced to fight tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="213">Effective 1 July 2015, excise duty is imposed on raw tobacco that has not been used or supplied to produce tobacco products, supplied to a different Member State or a third country or in respect of which the origin, purpose of use or person to whom such tobacco should be supplied has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="214">Raw tobacco handling restrictions</seg>
<seg id="215">Raw tobacco handling restrictions have been added to the supervision of the movement and production of tobacco products, labelling unit packages with excise stamps and restriction of sales to defined locations.</seg>
<seg id="216">Facilities for processing raw tobacco and producing tobacco products are not subject to supervision by the customs authorities.</seg>
<seg id="217">Storing raw tobacco for other purposes than producing tobacco products may only be carried out by a registered person. Such tobacco must not be processed or treated further, however.</seg>
<seg id="218">Only a person that fulfils the personal conditions applicable to applicants, governing bodies and responsible representatives may become a registered person. This condition has to be satisfied for the entire registration period.</seg>
<seg id="219">The registration conditions are as follows: a) authorisation to carry on a trade that allows storage of raw tobacco, b) credibility, c) debt-free status, d) the person storing the raw tobacco has not been disqualified from such activity, thus preventing him from carrying on such activity, e) the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, and f) payment of a guarantee of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 740,000).</seg>
<seg id="220">Electronic records must contain the date of receipt or dispatch of the raw tobacco, document number, identification of business partner, and amount and type of tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="221">Notification of each receipt of raw tobacco by the registered person storing raw tobacco has to be made to the excise duty administrator 24 to 72 hours prior to receipt or dispatch.</seg>
<seg id="222">Data about the business partner, amount of raw tobacco, storage address, purpose of use, and carrier are reported.</seg>
<seg id="223">Notification of amount of raw tobacco received or dispatched in the respective year is submitted by the entity either at the same time that the registration application is submitted or by the end of January of the respective year.</seg>
<seg id="224">Notifications are submitted electronically via data box in PDF format.</seg>
<seg id="225">Movement of raw tobacco has to be accompanied by a document containing the prescribed information.</seg>
<seg id="226">Excise duty legislation in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="227">The legal framework regulating excise duty in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation, thus helping to create a common tax system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Each type of excise duty is defined in Slovak legislation, with such legislation being similar to that of the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="229">Specification of legislation</seg>
<seg id="230">Excise duty legislation comprises four laws according to the subject of the excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="231">Harmonisation has been achieved by the adoption of the following excise duty laws: Act No 98/2004 Coll., on excise duty on mineral oil; Act No 106/2004 Coll., on excise duty on tobacco products; Act No 530/2011 Coll., on excise duty on alcoholic beverage; Act No 609/2007 Coll., on excise duty on electricity, coal, and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="232">All excise duty regulations represent substantive law regulations and focus on taxation of the subject of the excise duty in the fiscal territory.</seg>
<seg id="233">Act No 563/2009 Coll., on excise duty administration (Tax Procedure Code) is a procedural law regulation governing excise duty administration and the rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.</seg>
<seg id="234">Within this legal framework, the provisions of Council Directive No 118/2008/EC of 16 December 2008, concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, as well as other EU directives and regulation, have been transposed.</seg>
<seg id="235">Structure of changes to legislation on the various types of excise duty in relation to the subject of the audit</seg>
<seg id="236">Since 2011, excise duty legislation has undergone fundamental changes according to the structure of the various types of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="237">In EMCS, movements of excisable goods under duty suspension have become fully electronic, replacing the administrative paper document accompanying such movement. This new electronic system tracks movements in real time.</seg>
<seg id="238">Within EMCS, the concept of suspension of access to tax entities was introduced in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="239">Under this concept, the customs office has the possibility to suspend access should there be warranted concern that taxes from previous tax periods will not be paid or levied or due to their unenforceability.</seg>
<seg id="240">The above pertains to the due date of the duty, as during movement, a guarantee has to be paid before excisable goods can be moved.</seg>
<seg id="241">This guarantee is released, however, once the goods reach their destination.</seg>
<seg id="242">Excise duty on mineral oil</seg>
<seg id="243">A fundamental change in excise duty administration occurred in 2011, when the possibility to use “red diesel” was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="244">Marked gas oil, commonly called “red diesel”, used to be classified as a mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="245">In the past, “red diesel” was used for specific purposes defined under the law, e. g., in agriculture, and a lower excise duty rate was applied to it.</seg>
<seg id="246">This change has had a positive impact on the revenue side of the state budget.</seg>
<seg id="247">The reason behind cancellation of “red diesel” was to reduce the public deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils, and reduce the administrative burden for the affected tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="248">In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created: motor fuel merchant.</seg>
<seg id="249">The purpose of this legal amendment was to introduce a recordkeeping obligation for all service stations.</seg>
<seg id="250">The obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from fuel distributors makes it easier to keep track of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel.</seg>
<seg id="251">In 2014, two new tax entities were introduced: fuel distributor and fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="252">This change was aimed at preventing tax evasion with respect to petrol and diesel and making the movement of these fuels easier to track (see Annex 4, Diagram A).</seg>
<seg id="253">Provisions on recordkeeping requirements for tax entities trading with lubricating and base oils were expanded as part of the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="254">In Slovakia, these mineral oils do not have to be marked with an indicator substance.</seg>
<seg id="255">Excise duty on tobacco products</seg>
<seg id="256">In efforts to fight tax evasion and monitor tobacco, the scope of the Tobacco Act was expanded to include a new type of tax entity: raw tobacco merchant.</seg>
<seg id="257">Raw tobacco is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="258">Also, the obligation to keep a record of technical equipment for the production tobacco products was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="259">The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps intended for labelling consumer packaged tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="260">Tobacco excise stamps are used to label cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="261">As part of the new system, an excise stamp user has to request the customs office to issue excise stamps electronically through the excise stamp offtake information system.</seg>
<seg id="262">This computerisation introduced electronic communication between tax entities and excise duty administrators.</seg>
<seg id="263">One state printer of excise stamps was appointed: the Kremnica Mint (Mincovňa Kremnica).</seg>
<seg id="264">Also, supervision over the printing of excise stamps was introduced.</seg>
<seg id="265">The changes contributed substantially to eliminating tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new excise stamp printing system strengthens the product control system because a unique identification number is generated for each excise stamp, and this number makes it easy to check whether the product comes from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="267">A unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd position is the checksum; 3rd position indicates whether the code belongs to the excise stamp or a group of packages; 4th position is the series identifier; 5th-8th position is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; and 9th-12th position is the decimal part of the sequence) can be also applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="268">Excise stamps designated for labelling cigarettes have to show the price of the cigarettes, the symbol for the valid excise duty rate, number of cigarettes per consumer package, and cigarette length.</seg>
<seg id="269">Excise duty on alcoholic beverages</seg>
<seg id="270">The biggest change in legislation affected ethyl alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three substantive law regulations were repealed and a single excise duty act on alcoholic beverages was created.</seg>
<seg id="271">The main reason for this new law was the need for a collective solution to the taxation of alcoholic beverages, their production, movement monitoring, excise bonds, and the need to improve the business environment in the respective field, make excise duty administration more effective, and reduce the administrative burden for SME.</seg>
<seg id="272">This new method for addressing the taxation of various types of alcoholic beverages introduced the use of a single excise duty rate for all alcoholic beverages with the percentage of actual ethyl alcohol by content being taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="273">In the case of still wine, sparkling wine, and fermented beverages, the percentage of ethyl alcohol by content in the final product is taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="274">The concentration in beer is also expressed as a percentage of actual ethyl alcohol content in the final product.</seg>
<seg id="275">The term minor producer of fermented beverages was introduced, essentially to exempt from excise duty those individuals who produce sparking fermented beverages up to 1,000 litres per fiscal year for their own use and their household’s use.</seg>
<seg id="276">The legislation introduced a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps for labelling consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under this new system, an excise stamp user has to request the customs office to issue excise stamps electronically through the excise stamp offtake information system.</seg>
<seg id="278">This computerisation introduced electronic communication between tax entities and excise duty administrators.</seg>
<seg id="279">One state printer of alcohol excise stamps was appointed: the Kremnica Mint (Mincovňa Kremnica).</seg>
<seg id="280">Supervision over the printing of excise stamps was also introduced.</seg>
<seg id="281">The changes contributed substantially to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Diagram B) and excise stamp counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="282">The new excise stamp printing system strengthens the product control system because a unique identification number is generated for each excise stamp, and this number makes it easy to check whether the product comes from legal sources.</seg>
<seg id="283">A unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd position is the checksum; 3rd position indicates whether the code belongs to the excise stamp or a group of packages; 4th position is the series identifier; 5th-8th position is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; and 9th-12th position is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.</seg>
<seg id="284">Comparison and assessment</seg>
<seg id="285">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="286">Excise duty on ethyl alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine, and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by a single piece of legislation: Act No 353/2003 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="287">Duties on solid fuel, natural and other gases and electricity are part of Act No 261/2007 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="288">In comparison, the Slovak Republic has a special law for each type of excise duty, save the excise duty act on alcoholic beverages, which applies to ethyl alcohol, beer, wine, and intermediate products.</seg>
<seg id="289">A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.</seg>
<seg id="290">As of 1 January 2015, the issuance of a licence to handle excisable products under the Excise Duty Act has been conditional in the Czech Republic upon proving the economic stability of applicants, which the customs authorities check annually by performing a financial analysis.</seg>
<seg id="291">In Slovakia, a similar analysis is performed only when deciding on waiving or reducing the excise guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="292">The FD SR performs fiscal supervision by having one its employees present when excise stamps are being affixed to alcohol and tobacco products, destroyed at the printer, and sold to individual users.</seg>
<seg id="293">The law states that only the state-owned enterprise Kremnica Mint (Mincovňa Kremnica) is authorised to print excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="294">In the Czech Republic, the customs authorities do not supervise the production of tobacco excise stamps and alcohol excise stamps at the printer.</seg>
<seg id="295">Tobacco excise stamps and alcohol excise stamps are collected from the printer by the authorised branch of the customs office in Kutná Hora.</seg>
<seg id="296">Tobacco excise stamps are purchased by tobacco producers at this branch; alcohol excise stamps are further distributed to the various excise duty administrators pertinent to the labelling sites.</seg>
<seg id="297">Czech legal regulations do not define producers of tobacco excise stamps and alcohol excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="298">In Slovakia, there is the obligation to register technical equipment for producing tobacco products or parts thereof. There is no such obligation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="299">In the Czech Republic, tobacco excise stamps bear the excise duty applicable to tobacco products, which is paid upon purchase of the tobacco excise stamps at the authorised customs office.</seg>
<seg id="300">Tobacco excise stamps in Slovakia do not contain the applicable excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="301">In the audited period, the Czech Republic introduced a refund of excise duty on mineral oils if such oils were used for primary plant production in agriculture, known as “green diesel”.</seg>
<seg id="302">Since 2017, this refund was extended to include motor oils used in animal production.</seg>
<seg id="303">In Slovakia, there is no support for farmers (support existed until 31 December 2010 in the form of “red diesel”).</seg>
<seg id="304">To boost the fight against tax fraud, the Czech Republic introduced the obligation on fuel distributors to pay a guarantee of CZK 20,000,000 (€ 740,000).</seg>
<seg id="305">A consequence of the introduction of this measure was a drop in the number of fuel distributors from 1,891 in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e., 1,717 fewer tax entities).</seg>
<seg id="306">Slovakia introduced a similar fuel distributor concept, but without the guarantee for securing the excise duty on mineral oil.</seg>
<seg id="307">Slovakia registered 303 distributors in 2014 and 407 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="308">Slovakia has also the concepts of motor fuel merchant and motor fuel consumer, with the locally pertinent customs offices issuing the respective authorisations.</seg>
<seg id="309">The Czech Republic has no such concept.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the Czech Republic, various mineral oils and some other mineral oils are subject to marking; in Slovakia, after the cancellation of “red diesel”, mineral oils are no longer marked.</seg>
<seg id="311">In the Czech Republic, alcohol excise stamps contain a unique 8-digit code to verify the source of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code that also indicates ethyl alcohol strength, according to which the excise stamp register is kept.</seg>
<seg id="312">Destroyed, lost, and returned excise stamps are recorded in the register on the business day that follows the decisive event.</seg>
<seg id="313">Excise stamps holders are obliged to provide notification of the use of the stamps by the same deadline.</seg>
<seg id="314">In Slovakia, excise stamps used to label consumer packaged alcohol contain a unique 12-digit identification number that is – in case of its usage - reported once per month to the excise duty administrator and is used to verify the authenticity of the excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="315">The register lists the number of purchased, used, and returned excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="316">Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have introduced the concept of mandatory registration or registry of alcohol distributors.</seg>
<seg id="317">In Slovakia, registration is conditional upon satisfaction of conditions linked directly to storage space exceeding 200m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaged alcohol of at least € 100,000 or the paid-up capital amounting € 100,000; and at least 10 employees.</seg>
<seg id="318">In the Czech Republic, registration is conditional upon payment to the 23 excise duty administrator of a guarantee of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e., € 185,000) which is kept for the entire period that the registration is valid.</seg>
<seg id="319">In Slovakia, when producing ethyl alcohol generally, and not only consumer packaged alcohol, the constant presence of an excise duty administrator is required.</seg>
<seg id="320">When producing consumer packaged alcohol in the Czech Republic, a special form of registration is required for the person obliged to label alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="321">This registration is conditional upon payment of a guarantee ranging from CZK 100,000 (i.e., € 3,700) to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e., € 185,000), depending on the number of purchased excise stamps, and installation of a camera surveillance system that allows the duty administrator to access it remotely at any time.</seg>
<seg id="322">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="323">The laws of the Czech Republic and Slovakia greatly exceed minimum EU requirements for the subject and administration of excise duties. They also respond to identified risks from other Member States and risks specific to the fiscal territories.</seg>
<seg id="324">The legislative changes adopted in the audited period allow excise duty administrators to prevent better possible tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="325">In the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of raw tobacco (e.g., of tobacco leaves), the Czech Republic and Slovakia introduced – above and beyond the legal framework of the EU – a duty on raw tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="326">Even though raw tobacco, or tobacco raw material, is not a harmonised tobacco product, the Czech Republic and Slovakia track its movement nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="327">The Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO can recommend the application of such measure in other EU Member States as well.</seg>
<seg id="328">In the Czech Republic, a good practice has shown that verifying the economic stability of applicants as a condition for issuance of a licence under the Excise Duty Act is a very successful way to reduce the risk of tax arrears.</seg>
<seg id="329">For this reason, both audit institutions recommend the application of such verification procedures in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="330">Distribution of excise stamps is more effective in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden the customs authorities with the costs associated with transporting the alcohol and tobacco excise stamps between the printer and the users of the stamps.</seg>
<seg id="331">The Slovak Financial Administration has a better overview of the existence and location of technical facilities for the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="332">The Czech Republic, however, has a more effective system for collecting excise duty on tobacco products as the order for tobacco excise stamps constitutes an excise declaration with subsequent payment of tax.</seg>
<seg id="333">By implementing the concept of motor fuel merchant and motor fuel consumer, the Slovak Financial Administration has a better overview of fuel sales points.</seg>
<seg id="334">The introduction of mandatory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control misuse of mineral oils with a reduced duty rate or exempted from duty.</seg>
<seg id="335">The Czech Republic (2013) and Slovakia (2014) introduced a new excise stamp containing an identification code.</seg>
<seg id="336">The Czech excise stamp also contains a registration code, whereas new legislation in Slovakia abandoned the introduction of such code.</seg>
<seg id="337">At this time, it is still not possible to assess the situation for the reason of the short time that the legislative changes have been in force.</seg>
<seg id="338">Implementation of effective labelling of consumer packaged alcohol with an excise stamp is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="339">The Slovak SAO and the Czech SAO can recommend implementation of this control measure even in other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="340">Slovakia takes a client-friendly approach to its alcohol distribution conditions, as it does not block the funds of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="341">Conversely, the Czech Republic takes a rather restrictive approach, as it requires the payment of a guarantee, which blocks the cash flow of tax entities. This measure does, however, reduce the risk of tax arrears arising.</seg>
<seg id="342">Development of excise duty revenues</seg>
<seg id="343">Excise duty is an indirect tax imposed by the state to increase its budget revenues and to regulate the sale of goods, the consumption of which is considered detrimental to an individual and/or society (the regulatory function of taxes).</seg>
<seg id="344">According to the strategic document Communication from the Commission “Europa 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth” of 3 March 2010, which is a part of the “Resource efficient Europe” flagship initiative, it is the European Commission’s aim to enhance a framework for the use of market-based instruments also in the form of revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.</seg>
<seg id="345">To fulfil the EC’s plan, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxes as part of a “greening” of taxation systems.</seg>
<seg id="346">The collection of excise duty revenues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, ethyl alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, natural gas, fuel, and electricity.</seg>
<seg id="347">Excise duties as a percentage of total tax revenues and as a percentage of GDP is monitored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="348">Both Supreme Audit Institutions used the following criteria for submitting a query on the OECD.</seg>
<seg id="349">The collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="350">In the Czech Republic, excise duties as a percentage of total tax revenues and as a percentage of GDP fell slightly according to OECD data.</seg>
<seg id="351">For conversion of CZK to € as at 31 December of the respective year, the European Central Bank (“ECB”) exchange rate was used.</seg>
<seg id="352">The nominal CZK/€ exchange rate in 2013 weakened year-on-year by 9.1% (from 25.140 to 27.425).</seg>
<seg id="353">The reason for this was chiefly the foreign exchange intervention policy of the Czech National Bank (“CNB”) Bank Board of 7 November 20136.</seg>
<seg id="354">The resulting excise duty collection, excise duty rates, and per capita revenue in € substantially decreased in response to the exchange rate difference.</seg>
<seg id="355">A significant decrease in the share of excise duty in 2014 was caused by a one-off failure in collecting revenue from excise duty on tobacco products because of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with an old VAT rate.</seg>
<seg id="356">The share of excise duty is also influenced by an increase in the collection of income taxes, which, as a result of an improvement of the Czech economy, grew substantially.</seg>
<seg id="357">Excise duty on mineral oils constitutes the biggest percentage of excise duty collection (about 55.7% in 2015); however, despite the marked growth of the economy, it fell compared to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="358">The collection of excise duty on mineral oil in 2013 and 2014 was substantially lower than in 2012 and in 2015, although in 2013, the registration of fuel distributors was introduced as a measure against fraud.</seg>
<seg id="359">The trend toward environmentally friendly cars and support for biofuels have negatively affected tax revenues.</seg>
<seg id="360">The percentage of duty on natural gas, duty on solid fuels, and duty on electricity on total tax collection is negilgible, which, compared to neighbouring countries, is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rate set by the EU.</seg>
<seg id="361">If rates do not increase in the future, their percentage will fall with regard to the ever increasing energy efficiency of buidlings and production processes.</seg>
<seg id="362">The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the aftershocks of far-reaching tax fraud consisting of placing untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol, or insufficiently denatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="363">After adopting numerous measures against such conduct in 2015 and a revival of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the amount collected in 2012 by € 4,000,000.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share of duty on tobacco products grew as a result of an increase in rates.</seg>
<seg id="365">Basic excise duty rates on tobacco products increased between 2012 and 2015. This occurred mainly because of the observance of the Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="366">Because of the foreign exchange intervention strategy of the CNB, the actual excise duty rate in Euro fell significantly, apart from the tax on tobacco products, which grew slightly.</seg>
<seg id="367">Indexation of excise duties is not set in relation to price growth, GDP, or standard of living; therefore, the function of excise duties to regulate socially undesirable activities might not be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the growing Czech economy and the rising standard of living, actual excise duty rates are falling.</seg>
<seg id="369">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="370">The collection of excise duties in connection with macroeconomic indicators in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="371">Current excise duty legislation in Slovakia does not address indexation of excise duty rates based on consumer prices because the rates are fixed.</seg>
<seg id="372">The full manifestation of the non-indexation of rates could especially be seen in the development of excise duty revenues on a cash basis and the proportion of such revenues to gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id="373">For the above reason, the proportion of tax revenues to GDP remained constant – without fluctuations or changes – in the audited period.</seg>
<seg id="374">The total proportion of excise duties to total tax revenues appears to be falling, which is caused by the ad valorem method of calculating the rates.</seg>
<seg id="375">The attained macroeconomic indicators are above average in relation to the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="376">Among all excise duties implemented in Slovakia, excise duty on mineral oils forms the largest proportion of annual tax revenues in the state budget. During the entire audited period, its percentage did not fall below 52% of such revenues.</seg>
<seg id="377">Excise duty on tobacco products constitutes the second biggest share.</seg>
<seg id="378">This duty forms about 32% of total excise duty collection.</seg>
<seg id="379">Between 2012-2015, the collection of excise duties per capita in Slovakia grew.</seg>
<seg id="380">This process was caused by the growth of excise duty rates on tobacco products, by higher purchasing power, and by bigger consumption of the population in the respective year.</seg>
<seg id="381">Excise duty revenues as a percentage of total tax revenues in Slovakia fell by 1.2 percentage points despite excise duty revenues growing.</seg>
<seg id="382">This was caused by the faster growth of total tax revenues compared to excise duty revenues.</seg>
<seg id="383">In the Czech Republic, the proportion of excise duty revenues to total tax revenues fell by about one percentage point between 2012 and 2015, which was influenced by the implementation of measures in the area of excise duties and by the significant growth of the collection of other taxes, especially income taxes.</seg>
<seg id="384">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="385">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="386">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="387">Because of the CNB foreign exchange intervention, actual excise duty rates in the Czech Republic fell.</seg>
<seg id="388">Energy taxes in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia as a percentage of total tax revenues is not growing and there is no shift from taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of various products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.</seg>
<seg id="389">The attained values of the share of excise duties are permanently above average compared to the OECD average.</seg>
<seg id="390">The total collection of excise duties is influenced especially by a change in the excise duty rates, development of economic conditions, and behaviour of the population.</seg>
<seg id="391">Future failures of the excise duty collection due to green measures, which the state is subsidising in various forms, will need to be replaced by revenues or by reducing public expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="392">As indexation of excise duty rates is not implemented in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, the regulatory function of such rates is reduced and the EU objectives to make Europe less dependent on environmentally unfriendly resources and the objectives in the area of reducing dependencies on alcohol and tobacco are not sufficiently supported.</seg>
<seg id="393">The higher consumption of various products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of the various products in €, is reflected in the higher per-capita collection of excise duties in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="394">excise Administrative costs of duty administration</seg>
<seg id="395">The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the relationship between the expenditure and revenue associated with the administration of excise duties, i.e., it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).</seg>
<seg id="396">The higher the resulting amount, the worse the effectiveness of administrative costs is.</seg>
<seg id="397">The effectiveness of an excise duty administrator during excise duty administration is influenced by the excise duty administrator’s powers and organisational structure, management of the organisation, legal environment, and level of computerisation of various operations.</seg>
<seg id="398">Determining the effectiveness of administrative costs of excise duty administration using the conversion coefficient method is based on the number of employees taking part in excise duty administration in a line management structure.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic (Czech Customs Administration), which is an independent organizational unit of the state and an accounting entity.</seg>
<seg id="400">In Slovakia, excise duty administration is in the purview of the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic (Slovak Financial Administration), with customs administration authorities comprising an organisational unit within this body, and costs and income being included in aggregate for the whole unit.</seg>
<seg id="401">To make it possible to compare the effectiveness of excise duty administration, expenditures and revenues of the Czech Financial Administration were also included in the model for calculating the effectiveness of administrative costs.</seg>
<seg id="402">Administrative costs of the excise duty administration in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="403">Excise duty administration is a set of administrative tasks carried out especially by the Czech Customer Administration.</seg>
<seg id="404">Some control tasks are carried out by other public administration bodies, but they are of negligible importance.</seg>
<seg id="405">Excise duty administration is performed by these bodies in particular:</seg>

<seg id="425">Representatives of the customs office and the GDC are present during the destruction of returned/damaged tobacco excise stamps to oversee the destruction process and draw up a record thereof.</seg>
<seg id="426">In the case of alcohol excise stamps, the director of the customs office appoints, through an internal act of management, a three-member committee for overseeing the shredding of rejected uncollected/returned excise stamps.</seg>

<seg id="433">Administrative costs of excise duty administration in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="434">Beginning 1 January 2012, the FD SR underwent a demanding transformation in line with the approved UNITAS programme.</seg>
<seg id="435">The transformation of the FD SR was also reflected in the composition of the employees of the newly created departments of the merged customs and excise duty administrations.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the organisational structure of the FD SR, the activities related to excise duty administration were included in multiple sections and the departments under them.</seg>
<seg id="437">Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic: Customs and Tax Section of the FD SR: Excise Duty Department (nation-wide jurisdiction):</seg>
<seg id="438">Excise Duty Unit – directs and coordinates excise duty administration operations; submits proposals and comments to legislative changes; elaborate expert opinions; issues decisions on delegation of the territorial jurisdiction of tax entities; allocates and cancels offtake registration numbers</seg>
<seg id="439">Fiscal Supervision Unit – directs and coordinates fiscal supervision and audit operations; carries out fiscal supervision.</seg>
<seg id="440">ELO and Excise Duty Systems Unit – directs and coordinates mutual administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties including information exchange via the SEED and MVS systems; carries out administration and updates in SysNeD and EMCS</seg>
<seg id="441">software Excise Stamp Unit – directs excise stamp handling and printing activities; carries out fiscal supervision over the handling and destruction of printing sheets and excise stamps at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="442">Section of the Vice-President of the Financial Administration</seg>
<seg id="443">Excise and Customs Duty Appeals Department (nation-wide jurisdiction):</seg>
<seg id="444">Excise Duty Appeals Unit – reviews decisions by the customs offices based on regular and extraordinary appeals; carries out activities under the second instance appellate procedure.</seg>
<seg id="445">The Customs Office Section was established in 2012 and is responsible for all nine customs offices, eight of which have jurisdiction over higher territorial divisions and one of which oversees tasks related to the external border of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="446">Customs Offices:</seg>
<seg id="447">Excise Duty Department – executes methodological activities related to the customs office branches; in the case of certain entities, it carries out excise duty administration tasks directly, specifically it makes decisions on registration applications (tax warehouse, authorised consignee, registered consignor), excise bond amounts and tax refunds; carries out supervision and tax audits; makes decisions on excise bond waivers; makes decisions on waivers of the obligations to ensure the presence of a customs officer at the alcohol warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="448">Legal Department – makes decisions on violations of excise regulations; performs activities related to regular and extraordinary remedies; conducts excise execution procedures.</seg>
<seg id="449">Customs Office Branch – decides on registrations (other than with regard to tax warehouses, authorised consignees and registered consignors) and excise guarantees amounts; imposes and refunds duties; carries out excise duty supervision and audits; decides on the seizure and forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="450">Customs Office Station – carries out excise duty supervision over the holding and movement of excisable goods; provides constant fiscal supervision at alcohol warehouses; decides on the seizure and forfeiture of goods.</seg>
<seg id="451">The expenditures of the Slovak Financial Administration on excise duty administration are constantly growing, because in addition to rising wages, investment into the effectiveness of excise duty administration and computerisation of financial administration is also growing.</seg>
<seg id="452">Although revenues from excise duties grew, spending grew faster because of IT modification related to the UNITAS project.</seg>
<seg id="453">Payroll expenses in Slovakia are affected substantially by the practice of constant fiscal supervision at alcohol warehouses, a system that is not applied in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="454">The expenditures of the Czech Customs Administration on excise duty administration between 2012 and 2015 grew more substantially in 2015. This rise was caused chiefly by growing payroll expenses and spending on technical support.</seg>
<seg id="455">In the Czech Republic, excise tax revenues grew roughly at the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="456">Compared to Slovakia, payroll expenses in the Czech Republic are positively effected by the broader powers of the customs administration, e.g., weighing trucks, checking fulfilment of road toll obligations.</seg>
<seg id="457">The effectiveness of administrative costs in Slovakia is deteriorating year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="458">Employee numbers have not changed substantially, but spending per employee has grown.</seg>
<seg id="459">In the Czech Republic, employee numbers have also not changed substantially, but spending per employee compared to Slovakia has not grown as fast.</seg>
<seg id="460">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="461">In the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, wage growth is an important factor behind the deteriorating effectiveness of administrative spending. This development can be seen as natural.</seg>
<seg id="462">In both countries, the fact that excise duty administration continues to be highly demanding administratively is a negative factor, which is confirmed by the fact that the number of employees involved in excise duty administration is not falling.</seg>
<seg id="463">In Slovakia, however, in light of lower incomes, excise duty administration is more demanding in terms of staffing.</seg>
<seg id="464">Performance indicators for excise duty administration</seg>
<seg id="465">Excise duty administration is a set of activities with the objective of accurately establishing, assessing, and enforcing payment of duties.</seg>
<seg id="466">The main processes in excise duty administration are duty assessment, activity authorisation and registration, supervision of movement, audits and identification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="467">The number of administrative tasks and entities under administration are indicators of the effectiveness of duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="468">The mutual relationship between the monitored indicator and the number of excise duty administrators expresses the effectiveness of excise duty administration and defines the cost-effectiveness of the specific activity.</seg>
<seg id="469">To handle certain products for business purposes and move them under duty suspension, it is necessary to apply for the respective authorisation and registration.</seg>
<seg id="470">The excise duty administrator is obliged to carry out systematic administration of authorised or registered entities, with a focus on supervision of fulfilment of legal regulations and the conditions stipulated by the excise duty administrator, for which there has to be adequate staffing.</seg>
<seg id="471">The numbers of authorisation or registrations as at 31 Dec. of the years concerned were the monitored indicators.</seg>
<seg id="472">The number of issued authorisations or registrations is not the same as the number of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="473">Administrative tasks are the specific administrative acts performed in connection with a specific matter.</seg>
<seg id="474">The frequency of the excise duty administrator’s most important tasks (duty assessments, administration of movement in EMCS) or activities which are a series of tasks ending with a report or decision are monitored.</seg>
<seg id="475">Performance indicators in CR</seg>
<seg id="476">Authorisation and registration for activity in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="477">Tax warehouse:</seg>
<seg id="478">Producing, processing, storing, accepting, or dispatching certain products can only be carried out based on a tax warehouse operation authorisation from the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="479">If a warehouse keeper operates several warehouses, a separate permit is issued for each warehouse and a separate excise guarantee is also required for each warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="480">An excise guarantee is not required in the case of distilleries under constant supervision by an excise duty administrator (i.e., the physical presence of an official and facilities secured by an excise duty administrator seal).</seg>
<seg id="481">In the Czech Republic, the practice of constant supervision is not applied.</seg>
<seg id="482">A warehouse keeper registers for tax under Section 125 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="483">The authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is required to move certain goods under duty suspension from the point of import to the tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in a different Member State, to the point of export in a different Member State or to a consignee in a different Member State [replaces the status of registered consignor under Article 4(10) of Council Directive No 2008/118/ EU].</seg>
<seg id="484">Tax warehouse statistics do not include authorisations to purchase electricity, natural gas, and solid fuels without duty, which by analogy are the same as a tax warehouse authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="485">Growers’ distilleries producing spirits with a 50% reduced duty rate (CZK 14 300/hl of ethyl alcohol) – fruit brandy for fruit growers, are not tax warehouses, and operating permits are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="486">A reduced duty rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure ethyl alcohol per grower’s household for personal consumption during the production period (July – June).</seg>
<seg id="487">Records of distillation by growers is kept by the distillery operators, who provide excise duty administrators with access to these records. These records have to contain information about the grower, the basic ingredient, origin of the fruit, and production of the distillate.</seg>
<seg id="488">Authorised consignees and temporary authorised consignees are, based on authorisation from the excise duty administrator and the stipulated conditions, entitled to receive once or repeatedly various products moved under the duty suspension from a different Member State.</seg>
<seg id="489">Authorised consignees are not warehouse keepers and, thus, may not store or dispatch certain products under duty suspension.</seg>
<seg id="490">Users of certain duty-exempt products are legal or natural persons who accept and use or, pursuant to Section 52a or 53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll., sell duty-exempt products to other users; users are tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.</seg>
<seg id="491">Certain tax exempt products can only be received or used based on a valid authorisation (licence) and from the supplier indicated on the authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="492">Based on the authorisation, duty exempt mineral oil can be sold to a different authorisation holder for use or to a user who is entitled to use the mineral oil without authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="493">It is possible to sell duty-exempt mineral oil without authorisation under specific situations laid down in the law, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="494">Less than 10 000 litres of waste oil per calendar year, provided that the user produced it himself or it is a product of his operations;</seg>
<seg id="495">Various duty-free mineral oils in packaging not exceeding 20 litres, intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat generation for the purpose of selling to end users.</seg>
<seg id="496">It is possible to move various duty-exempt products with a duty-exemption document.</seg>
<seg id="497">Distributors of consumer packaged alcohol are authorised, upon mandatory registration with the excise duty administrator, to sell or otherwise move alcohol placed in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="498">Raw tobacco warehouse keepers are authorised, upon registration with the excise duty administrator, to store raw tobacco for purposes other than the production of tobacco products.</seg>
<seg id="499">Persons handling special mineral oils are authorised, based on certain conditions, to purchase, sell, or otherwise move special mineral oils that are stored in bulk or in packaging exceeding 220 litres.</seg>
<seg id="500">Fuel distributors are authorised, based on a concession (licence) and registration with an excise duty administrator and under certain conditions, to sell fuel in the Czech Republic, apart from fuel from service stations.</seg>
<seg id="501">Movement of fuel has to be accompanied by a tax document, bill of sale or contract of carriage (shipping document) or, as the case may be, distribution schedule and fuel offtake receipts.</seg>
<seg id="502">These documents may be substituted with electronic documents sent to the excise duty administrator prior to moving the goods.</seg>
<seg id="503">Service station operators are the owners of the fuel sold at service stations.</seg>
<seg id="504">Service stations are sites where fuel is issued and sold, usually into a fuel tank, based on a permit from the building authorities.</seg>
<seg id="505">The Ministry of Industry and Trade keeps a register of service stations and their operators, under the following classification: Registered – regular sale or dispatch of fuel, usually into vehicle fuel tanks With defined access – operated usually on the company grounds (e.g., quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport companies, construction yards); sales to other parties is restricted based on specific contractual relationships Private – refuelling sites only for the operator’s own needs.</seg>
<seg id="506">A structure or operating tank located in a plant (e.g., on a chassis) is not deemed a service station if the fuel is available for own use only.</seg>
<seg id="507">Operating tanks are not subject to a permit from the excise duty administrator and are not registered.</seg>
<seg id="508">Natural and legal persons can purchase, receive and sell liquid petroleum gas in free circulation for further sale based on authorisation from the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="509">Such persons also need authorisation if they purchase or receive liquid petroleum gas exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year for their own use.</seg>
<seg id="510">Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="511">A tax audit is a set of tasks that includes examination of tax obligations, claims made by a tax entity, or other circumstances required to duly ascertain and assess tax relating to one tax proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="512">A tax audit can be performed jointly for several tax proceedings pertaining to one tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="513">A tax audit can be repeated only under conditions and reasons laid down in law at the time of commencement of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="514">A tax audit is performed within a tax assessment period, which constitutes three years. Under conditions laid down in law, this period may be extended by one year (e.g., submission of a supplementary declaration related to the duty in question, commencement of criminal proceedings related to the duty in question) or suspended (court proceedings, international cooperation).</seg>
<seg id="515">This period, under conditions laid down in law, ends no later than upon the elapse of the ten years that follow expiration of the deadline for filing a regular tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="516">Tax administrators are not obliged to perform an audit of every tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="517">The commencement of a tax audit suspends deadlines for the possibility of submitting supplementary declarations or supplementary accounting by the tax entity (Section 141 Act No 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts regular deadlines for assessing tax (Section 148 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="518">Based on the results of the audit, additional tax may be assessed ex officio.</seg>
<seg id="519">An on-site inspection is a separate, time-restricted task (one day) during which the excise duty administrator looks for evidence and searches the premises, goods, documents, records, transport means and packaging of tax subjects and other persons involved in excise duty administration outside the excise duty administrator’s premises (e.g., at the tax entity’s premises, on the road when the goods are being moved).</seg>
<seg id="520">The tax administrator is authorised to take temporary possession of documents and items, take samples thereof, or seize them.</seg>
<seg id="521">Taxes cannot be assessed based on the on-site inspection alone, but the tax entity can be asked to file a supplementary declaration [Section 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.].</seg>
<seg id="522">A review of movement-related data in EMCS is not considered as an on-site inspection.</seg>
<seg id="523">An order of alcohol excise stamps at the locally pertinent tax administrator may be made only by a registered person having the duty to label alcohol and such activity is carried out via intelligent forms that are imported automatically into the Alcohol Labeller Register.</seg>
<seg id="524">The excise duty administrator processes the order, assesses the adequacy of the amount of excise stamps ordered and orders production.</seg>
<seg id="525">It does not oversee the production of excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="526">Production is provided by the state enterprise Státní tiskárna cenin, státní podnik (government printing works).</seg>
<seg id="527">The recipient of the excise stamps collects the excise stamps from the tax administrator with jurisdiction over the labelling site.</seg>
<seg id="528">An order for tobacco excise stamps for labelling cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, and smoking tobacco serves as an excise duty declaration.</seg>
<seg id="529">The value of the tobacco excise stamps corresponds to the duty obligation, with the user of the tobacco excise stamps being obliged to pay for them within 60 days of collecting them from the tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="530">The user is obliged to calculate the duty obligation arising from the tobacco excise stamp order.</seg>
<seg id="531">This deadline applies only if the value of the tobacco excise stamps is secured by a guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="532">The tobacco excise stamp order is submitted in writing on a form specified by the Ministry of Finance or through a data box with intelligent forms being available.</seg>
<seg id="533">The production of tobacco excise stamps is provided by the state enterprise Státní tiskárna cenin, státní podnik (government printing works).</seg>
<seg id="534">The authorised tax administrator is the Central Bohemian Customs Office (Kutná Hora branch), which arranges the purchase and transport of tobacco excise stamps to the tax administrator, who then distributes them and keeps track of their movement, storage and use at the users.</seg>
<seg id="535">Excise declarations includes regular excise declarations, supplementary excise declarations, and amended excise declarations, including tobacco excise stamp orders, submitted by tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="536">Excise declarations do not include tax declarations in customs proceedings based on customs declarations and tax refund claims pertaining to: Mineral oils used for heating Other petrol used in business in other way than for heating and engine propulsion Mineral oil used for primary agricultural production Imposition of penalties includes administrative proceedings concerning violations of legal regulations and is a set of successive tasks.</seg>
<seg id="537">The international exchange of information about tax entities (Excise Liaison Office – ELO) in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form of: an application for administrative cooperation; a response to the application for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; reports of events; reports on controls.</seg>
<seg id="538">Movement in the duty suspension regime between the Czech Republic and Member States of the European Union, where the Czech customs office is the excise duty administrator of the tax warehouse of receipt or dispatch or of the authorised consignee.</seg>
<seg id="539">Performance indicators in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="540">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="541">Excise duty administration in Slovakia is in the purview of the customs authorities and the Excise Department of the Customs and Tax Section of the FD SR, where the excise duty administration procedure is regulated by various excise duty laws and the Tax Procedure Code.</seg>
<seg id="542">These laws lay down not only the scope of power of the customs offices and FD SR in excise duty administration, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in relation to registration for or payment of excise duties.</seg>
<seg id="543">The biggest year-on-year increase in tax entities was registered between 2012 and 2013 and amounted to 234%. This rise was caused by an increase in the number of issued tax warehouse authorisations, increase in registrations of authorised consignees, and registration of a larger number of user undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Legislation specified the movement of certain bulk mineral oils as well as the notification obligations for moving minerals oils in bulk or in containers exceeding 150 litres or 230 litres, as the case may be, and expanded the list of mineral oils subject to control and transporting procedures to include anti-knock preparations, oxidation inhibitors, feldspathic inhibitors, viscosity improvers, and anticorrosive preparations.</seg>
<seg id="545">In respect of lubricating oils, the obligation to indicate their kinematic viscosity was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="546">The sections below discuss the registration process for certain tax entities under Slovak law in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="547">Tax warehouse keeper</seg>
<seg id="548">In connection with registration of tax warehouse keepers under Slovak national legislation, a person who wishes to operate a tax warehouse has to register as well as apply for a tax warehouse operating permit for each type of excisable commodity.</seg>
<seg id="549">The resulting decision in the registration procedure is a certificate of registration for the respective excise duty through which the warehouse keeper acquires legal subjectivity for all warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="550">At the same time, the customs office issues a tax warehouse operating licence which authorises the warehouse keeper to produce, process, receive, or dispatch excisable goods under duty suspension.</seg>
<seg id="551">If a warehouse keeper has a warehouse in several locations, the excise duty administrator will issue a separate warehouse operating licence for each tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="552">The movement of excisable goods under duty suspension are monitored electronically via EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="553">For each movement, a unique reference code, called an ARC code, is generated.</seg>
<seg id="554">It is possible to use this code to monitor the movement on-line, i.e., in real time.</seg>
<seg id="555">If the tax warehouse keeper is also an authorised alcohol distributor, he is obliged to notify the customs office electronically about the name of the consumer packaged alcohol, the volume of ethyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol concentration by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol, and the EU barcode for each new type of consumer packaging that he is placing into free circulation no later than on the day of placing the alcohol into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="556">Registered consignor</seg>
<seg id="557">A registered consignor is a unique type of tax entity that cannot at the same time be registered as a tax warehouse keeper even if he places excisable goods into free circulation after releasing them from duty suspension regime.</seg>
<seg id="558">In connection with the registration of registered consignors under Slovak national legislation, a person who wishes to dispatch excisable items under duty suspension after releasing them into free tax circulation has to request the customs office at the same time for registration and authorisation to dispatch excisable items under duty suspension.</seg>
<seg id="559">The customs office issues a certificate of registration for the respective excise duty and, at the same time, issues an authorisation (licence) to dispatch excisable items under duty suspension upon being released into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="560">Fruit growers’ distilleries</seg>
<seg id="561">To operate a fruit growers’ distillery, at first it is necessary to obtain a permit to produce ethyl alcohol at a distillery from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="562">The permit alone does not authorise the holder to operate a growers’ distillery, however.</seg>
<seg id="563">To be allowed to operate a growers’ distillery, a person must register at the customs office as a fruit growers’ distillery operator and request issuance of the respective registration certificate.</seg>
<seg id="564">The customs office issues the registration certificate for the respective excise duty, which also authorises the growers’ distillery operator to produce ethyl alcohol in the growers’ distillery.</seg>
<seg id="565">The purpose of a growers’ distillery is to provide a service for fruit growers.</seg>
<seg id="566">A growers’ distillery cannot operate as a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="567">Legislators have allowed alcohol produced in a growers’ distillery to employ a 50% deduction on the basic duty rate, i.e., € 540/hl of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="568">The reduced duty rate applies to ethyl alcohol produced in a growers’ distillery up to 43l. of alcohol per grower and his household during one production period in the fiscal territory.</seg>
<seg id="569">The production period is from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="570">As a production year is not the same as a calendar year, it is possible to apply the reduced duty rate on the ethyl alcohol produced several times within a single calendar year, even though the ethyl alcohol in question is produced over two production periods.</seg>
<seg id="571">Ethyl alcohol is produced outside the duty suspension regime, which means that the produced ethyl alcohol is in free tax circulation.</seg>
<seg id="572">The grower pays the growers’ distillery not only the excise duty and value added tax, but also a fee for the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="573">The growers’ distillery provides the growers with the delivery order, which is a document that proves not only the origin of the ethyl alcohol and how it was acquired, but also the payment of excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="574">The movement of such ethyl alcohol is not subject to monitoring by the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="575">Importer of consumer packaged goods</seg>
<seg id="576">National legislation allows persons who, as part of their business, wish to import consumer packaged alcohol or cigarettes from a third country and place these commodities into free tax circulation in the fiscal territory, to request the customs office to be registered in the register of importers of consumer packaged goods.</seg>
<seg id="577">An importer of consumer packaged goods does not register himself for the respective excise duty, but the customs office issues confirmation of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaged goods.</seg>
<seg id="578">This confirmation authorises the importer to import consumer packaged alcohol or cigarettes from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the same time, before excise stamps are issued, the importer has to pay a guarantee up to the amount of the duty applicable to the amount of the ethyl alcohol or cigarettes that he wishes to place into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="580">The importer of consumer packaged goods may place into free circulation only such consumer packaged goods that have excise stamps affixed to them.</seg>
<seg id="581">For this reason, he must present the number and identification number of the excise stamps exported to a third country to the export customs office.</seg>
<seg id="582">When importing, the importer is obliged to confirm to the import customs office the number of excise stamps imported from a third country.</seg>
<seg id="583">When importing consumer packaged goods, the importer observes customs regulations according to which excise duty is part of the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="584">If the consumer packaged goods is released into free circulation, the paid guarantee will be refunded to the importer or it can be used to settle the customs debt.</seg>
<seg id="585">An importer of consumer packaged goods is not a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="586">If the importer of consumer packaged alcohol is at the same time a person authorised to distribute ethyl alcohol, he is obliged to inform the customs office electronically about the name of the consumer packaged alcohol, amount and concentration of ethyl alcohol by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol, and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaged alcohol that he is placing into free tax circulation no later than on the day of placing the packaged goods into free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="587">Merchant of consumer packaged alcohol in free circulation</seg>
<seg id="588">For the purpose of monitoring ethyl alcohol in free circulation and eliminating tax evasion, legislators have introduced the concept of merchant of consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="589">A person who wishes to be a holder of a sales permit has to request the customs office for the permit and satisfy statutory conditions (trade licence to sell goods, no record of intentional economic crimes, no revocation of his trade licence in the last ten years, being not in liquidation or in bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="590">As consumer packaged alcohol is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during the movement of this commodity.</seg>
<seg id="591">An invoice containing the number of the distribution licence holder is sufficient to demonstrate how the consumer packaged alcohol was acquired.</seg>
<seg id="592">For each establishment, the authorisation holder is obliged to keep for each calendar month: a record of the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol received, the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol dispatched, the state of inventory of consumer packaged alcohol as at the last day of the month, and a record of shortage or surpluses in the number of pieces of received and dispatched consumer packaged goods.</seg>
<seg id="593">The authorisation holder also has the obligation to purchase or otherwise take off consumer packaged alcohol only from a person authorised to distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="594">Distributor of consumer packaged alcohol</seg>
<seg id="595">For the purpose of monitoring the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and eliminating tax evasion, legislators have introduced the concept of distributor of consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="596">A person who wishes to become a distribution licence holder has to apply to the customs office for a distribution licence.</seg>
<seg id="597">The applicant has to fulfil the statutory conditions (trade licence to sell goods, storage area of more than 200m2, annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaged alcohol of at least € 100,000 or paid up registered capital of at least € 100,000, at least 10 employees, no arrears payable to the customs office, no arrears on mandatory payments, no record of economic crime, no revocation of his licence in the last ten years, and being not in liquidation or bankruptcy).</seg>
<seg id="598">As the consumer packaged alcohol is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during movement of this commodity.</seg>
<seg id="599">An invoice containing the number of the distribution licence holder is sufficient to demonstrate how the consumer packaged alcohol was acquired.</seg>
<seg id="600">For each establishment, the authorisation holder is obliged to keep for each calendar year: a record of the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol received, the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol dispatched, the inventory of consumer packaged alcohol as at the last day of the month, and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of pieces of received and dispatched consumer packaged goods.</seg>
<seg id="601">The distribution licence holder also has the obligation to purchase or otherwise take off consumer packaged alcohol only from another person authorised to distribute it.</seg>
<seg id="602">A distribution licence holder reports data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="603">Motor fuel merchant</seg>
<seg id="604">To monitor motor fuels in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced: motor fuel merchant.</seg>
<seg id="605">The Slovak Republic has no a special regulation on service stations.</seg>
<seg id="606">For this reason, service stations are treated as motor fuel merchants under Slovak legislation.</seg>
<seg id="607">A person who wishes to sell petrol, diesel, or LPG to end users as part of his business activities in the respective fiscal territory has to obtain a sales licence from the customs office first and present a document showing that the storage facility is certified and equipped with a suitable, certified metering device for measuring the amount of mineral oil received and dispatched. The storage tank also has to meet technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="608">If the motor fuel merchant is also a warehouse keeper, authorised consignee, or authorised consigner, the customs office automatically also issues him a licence to sell motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="609">A motor fuel merchant is also obliged to keep a record of purchased and sold petrol, diesel, or LPG for each calendar month and to report any new motor fuel supplier (distributor) to the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="610">A motor fuel merchant has the legal obligations to purchase or otherwise take off motor fuel only from motor fuel distributors or registered persons.</seg>
<seg id="611">As the motor fuel is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during its movement.</seg>
<seg id="612">However, if motor fuel is being supplied using tank trucks, distributors will print out a delivery receipt from the metering device built into the tank truck for the merchant.</seg>
<seg id="613">This document contains the amount of motor fuel delivered, date and time of delivery, and the registration number allocated to the fuel truck by the Road Traffic Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="614">An invoice containing the motor fuel distributor’s number allocated to him by the excise duty administrator is also sufficient proof of the method of acquisition of motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="615">During their supervision over mineral oils, excise duty administrators in the Slovak Republic have encountered tax evasion related to the movement of these commodities.</seg>
<seg id="616">Such evasion pertains chiefly to efforts to avoid road checks during transport, with carriers using secondary roads and bypassing the toll system due to movements being monitored more strictly.</seg>
<seg id="617">The same holds true for transport of mineral oils in tank trucks that have been modified to have a false bottom.</seg>
<seg id="618">Often, illegal transport takes place using two vehicles, with the first reporting any mobile patrols so that an alternative route can be found to avoid checks.</seg>
<seg id="619">In addition, light heating oils or waste oils are often mixed with motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="620">Motor fuel distributor</seg>
<seg id="621">To monitor motor fuels in free tax circulation and eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced: motor fuel distributor.</seg>
<seg id="622">A person who wishes to distribute petrol, diesel, or LPG in the fiscal territory must first submit a document showing that his storage facilities are certified and equipped with a suitable certified metering device and a list of suppliers and clients.</seg>
<seg id="623">In addition to other legal obligations, a motor fuel distributor is also obliged to keep a separate record for each establishment showing the petrol, diesel, or LPG sold in each calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="624">A motor fuel distributor has the legal obligation to purchase or otherwise take off motor fuels from other motor fuel distributors or registered persons only.</seg>
<seg id="625">In the respective fiscal territory, a motor fuel distributor can only sell fuel to another motor fuel distributor, registered person, or motor fuel consumer.</seg>
<seg id="626">However, if motor fuel is being supplied using tank trucks, the distributor will print out for the merchant a delivery receipt from the metering device built into the tank truck.</seg>
<seg id="627">This document contains the amount of motor fuel delivered, date and time of delivery, and the registration number allocated to the fuel truck by the Road Traffic Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="628">As the motor fuel is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during its movement.</seg>
<seg id="629">An invoice containing the motor fuel distributor’s or registered person’s number allocated by the excise duty administrator is also sufficient proof of the method of acquisition of motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="630">Motor fuel consumer</seg>
<seg id="631">Motor fuel consumers have a special status under national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="632">A person who purchases petrol, diesel, or LPG in the fiscal territory for his own use and stores this mineral oil in a storage facility able to hold 15,000 litres or more is obliged to report this to the customs office at the latest before using the storage facility for this first time.</seg>
<seg id="633">The customs office will include the motor fuel consumer in a registry.</seg>
<seg id="634">In addition to the statutory particulars, the motor fuel consumer is obliged to state the address where the storage facility is located.</seg>
<seg id="635">In practice, motor fuel consumers constitute major carriers, cooperatives, bus lines, road construction companies, and other entities.</seg>
<seg id="636">The storage facilities have to be certified and equipped with a metering device that measures the amount of motor fuel off-taken and used (level indicator, gauge rod).</seg>
<seg id="637">The tank must meet technical standards.</seg>
<seg id="638">A motor fuel consumer may only purchase motor fuel from a motor fuel distributor or from a registered person.</seg>
<seg id="639">As the motor fuel is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during its movement.</seg>
<seg id="640">However, if motor fuel is being supplied using tank trucks, distributors will print out for the consumer a delivery receipt from the metering device built into the tank truck.</seg>
<seg id="641">This document contains the amount of motor fuel delivered, date and time of delivery, and the registration number allocated to fuel truck by the Road Traffic Inspectorate.</seg>
<seg id="642">An invoice containing the motor fuel distributor’s or registered person’s number allocated to it by the excise duty administrator is also sufficient proof of the method of acquisition of motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="643">During their supervision over mineral oils, excise duty administrators in the Slovak Republic registers duty evasion related to the movement of these commodities.</seg>
<seg id="644">Small independent brewery</seg>
<seg id="645">A small independent brewery operator is a person who brews beer as a business and fulfils certain statutory conditions.</seg>
<seg id="646">Assuming the fulfilment of certain statutory conditions, a small independent brewery can apply a reduced duty rate of €2.652 per hl/percent of actual ethyl alcohol by volume.</seg>
<seg id="647">Annual beer production is limited to 200,000 hl of beer.</seg>
<seg id="648">As beer production is outside the duty suspension regime, an accompanying document is not required during movement because the beer is in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="649">A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="650">In practice, such breweries are small family enterprises that also operate a restaurant or pub where they offer beer that they have brewed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="651">Administrative tasks in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="652">Excise duty supervision over certain tax entities is divided up under Slovak law as follows.</seg>
<seg id="653">The greatest increase in administrative tasks, i.e., by 5.3%, was registered in 2012 and 2013. This was caused by the greater number of movements executed in EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="654">Conversely, the greatest year-on-year drop was registered in 2013 and 2014, specifically by 4.3%, which was caused by a smaller number of completed tax audits as well as a smaller number of submitted tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="655">The drop was due in part to changes in legislation.</seg>
<seg id="656">Tax audits</seg>
<seg id="657">Tax audits performed by the customs office aim to discover or examine facts required for the proper assessment of duties.</seg>
<seg id="658">When performing tax audits, customs office employees present a tax audit authorisation to identify themselves. This authorisation contains information about the purpose and subject of the audit and periods covered by the audit.</seg>
<seg id="659">In practice, this means that the audited period can be as short as one month or even as long as a number of taxation periods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The scope of the audited periods is determined by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="661">A tax audit begins with a tax audit commencement report being drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="662">Documents received or taken by the customs office are confirmed by a receipt.</seg>
<seg id="663">The customs office is obliged to return any borrowed documents within 30 days of the end of a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="664">A customs office employee draws up a tax audit report.</seg>
<seg id="665">If the tax audit finds a difference in the amount that the auditee was to pay, to report, or claimed as a duty refund, the customs shall send, along with the audit report, a request for a response to the report results.</seg>
<seg id="666">The tax audit ends on the day of delivery of the report.</seg>
<seg id="667">The deadline for performing the tax audit is one year from the date of its commencement.</seg>
<seg id="668">A tax audit of registered persons and of certain listed persons is carried out as necessary, but at least once by the date of expiration of the right to levy tax, which is five years.</seg>
<seg id="669">The FD SR issued an internal regulation governing such deadline to unify the excise duty administration procedures in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="670">On-site inspections</seg>
<seg id="671">On-site inspections are performed by the excise duty administrator to find evidence and to examine and ascertain facts that are required for excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="672">A customs office employee draws up a record of the on-site inspection and provides the tax entity with a copy.</seg>
<seg id="673">When carrying out an on-site inspection, the custom office employee has unrestricted access to the tax entity’s land, operating facilities, rooms and premises, including transport vehicles, transport packaging, and accounting documents.</seg>
<seg id="674">Clearance of the amount of ethyl alcohol produced is examined through on-site inspections.</seg>
<seg id="675">The findings form the basis for a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="676">During an on-site inspection, the customs office is entitled to take samples and seize items.</seg>
<seg id="677">The FD SR issued an internal regulation governing fiscal supervision and on-site inspections for individual excisable goods to unify excise duty administration procedures in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="678">Constant fiscal supervision in alcohol warehouses</seg>
<seg id="679">When the Slovak Republic acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004, a change in the area of excise duty administration occurred.</seg>
<seg id="680">The need for more effective spending of resources from the state budget in connection with the administration of excise duty on ethyl alcohol, improving the business environment in the respective area and implementing legislative tools for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the respective area resulted in new legislation being adopted in 2004 in connection with excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="681">One of the measures introduced by the new legislation was not only the transfer of excise duty administration duties performed by tax offices to the customs offices, but also the need for the presence of an excise duty administrator in tax warehouses for ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="682">In Slovakia, national legislation stipulates that receiving, dispatching, producing, or processing ethyl alcohol in a tax warehouse is possible only in the presence of a customs office employee.</seg>
<seg id="683">The above does not apply to tax warehouses that receive, store, or dispatch consumer packaged alcohol only.</seg>
<seg id="684">The customs office is also obliged to ensure that the employee in the tax warehouse does not hinder the receipt, dispatch, production, or processing of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="685">The tax warehouse keeper is obliged to ensure that the customs office employee has suitable working conditions at the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="686">The tax warehouse keeper then charges the customs office for the space set up for the customs office employee on a monthly basis based on an agreement concluded with the FD SR.</seg>
<seg id="687">When producing, processing, or storing ethyl alcohol at a tax warehouse, the ethyl alcohol production and storage facilities have to be set up to ensure that it is possible to ascertain at any time the amount of ethyl alcohol produced, processed, and stored.</seg>
<seg id="688">The amount of spirits on stock and the ethyl alcohol content thereof must also be ascertainable at any time.</seg>
<seg id="689">If a tax warehouse does not receive, dispatch, produce, or process ethyl alcohol, the customs office can waive the obligation to arrange the continuous presence of a customs officer. The premises, however, must be sealed off by the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="690">This option is not often used in practice because tax warehouse keepers find the continuous presence of a customs officer beneficial.</seg>
<seg id="691">Some tax warehouse keepers make use of the possibility under Act No 467/2002 Coll., on the production of ethyl alcohol and its placement on the market, and use ethyl alcohol production facilities and equipment in fruit growers’ distilleries also for the purposes of a distillery of spirits which has to be a tax warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="692">Constant fiscal supervision in alcohol tax warehouses is provided by about 250 customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="693">Issuance of vouchers for the collection of alcohol excise stamps</seg>
<seg id="694">To be able to take off excise stamps, a request has to be submitted to the customs office for allocation of a registration number and issuance of a voucher for the collection of alcohol excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="695">An alcoholic beverage that is ethyl alcohol is understood as a goods under the combined nomenclature of 2207 and 2208 with actual ethyl alcohol by volume exceeding 1.2%.</seg>
<seg id="696">The excise stamp is intended to label consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="697">Consumer packaged alcohol is deemed to be a sealed consumer package filled with alcohol intended for direct human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="698">Consumer packaged alcohol with a combined nomenclature code of 2207 and 2208 can be placed into free circulation in the fiscal territory only if an excise stamp is affixed to it.</seg>
<seg id="699">Only tax warehouse keepers, authorised consignees, and importers of consumer packaged goods placing consumer packaged alcohol into free tax circulation may label consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="700">The excise stamp contains among others a 14-digit identification number which consists of the registration number (digits in 1st-6th place), volume of ethyl alcohol (digits in 7th-11th place), and concentration of ethyl alcohol by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol (digits in the 12th-14th place).</seg>
<seg id="701">Original design of alcohol excise stamp:</seg>
<seg id="702">The customs office allocates a unique registration number to each excise stamp user.</seg>
<seg id="703">Only an excise stamp with an identification number corresponding to the volume of the consumer packaged alcohol, ethyl alcohol concentration by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol, and excise stamp user can be used to label consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new excise stamp information system.</seg>
<seg id="705">The objective of this new system was to facilitate and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps intended for labelling consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="706">Only tax warehouse keepers, authorised consignees, importers of consumer packaged alcohol, and consignees (customers) of ethyl alcohol may label consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="707">Excise stamp users who wish to take off excise stamps according to the “new system” have to file a request with the customs office to have excise stamps issued electronically.</seg>
<seg id="708">Excise stamp users has to use the electronic excise stamp system not only to request that excise stamps be issued electronically, but also to report data required under Slovak national legislation and to keep a record of excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="709">No fewer than 500 excise stamps, or a multiple thereof, may be ordered.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the same way, the excise duty administrator will communicate with excise stamp users through the electronic excise stamp system, especially when notifying them about the number of excise stamps they will be able to take off or when stipulating the deadline for collecting the excise stamps at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="711">Before collecting the excise stamps, the excise stamp user is obliged to deposit on the excise duty administrator’s account funds corresponding to the price of the excise stamps that he can take off and that the customs office notifies him about.</seg>
<seg id="712">The price of the excise stamps takes into account printing fees but does not cover excise duty.</seg>
<seg id="713">Excise stamps may only be printed by the state enterprise Mincovňa Kremnica, štátny podnik (the Kremnica Mint).</seg>
<seg id="714">The FD SR performs fiscal supervision over the handing of excise stamps and their destruction at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="715">The FD SR is obliged to arrange the presence of one of its employee at the printing house during the handling of excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="716">The FD SR arranges the sale of excise stamps to excise stamp users at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="717">It is possible to take off excise stamps only from the Financial Directorate employee at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="718">Issuance of vouchers for the collection of tobacco excise stamps</seg>
<seg id="719">An excise stamp user has to request the customs office for allocation of a user registration number and permit for the offtake of excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="720">Consumer packaged cigarettes can be placed into free circulation only if an excise stamp is affixed to them.</seg>
<seg id="721">Only a cigarette manufacturing company can affix excise stamps to consumer packaged cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="722">Only a tax warehouse keeper, authorised consignee, or tobacco product importer who wishes to place tobacco products into free circulation in the fiscal territory can be an excise stamp user.</seg>
<seg id="723">Only an excise stamp that contains information corresponding to the respective price of the cigarettes, number of cigarettes in the package, length of the cigarettes, valid tax rate symbol, and the offtake registration number can be used to label consumer packaged cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="724">It is possible to sell the consumer packaged cigarettes to end consumers only for the price given in the excise stamp.</seg>
<seg id="725">At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new excise stamp information system.</seg>
<seg id="726">The objective of this new system was to facilitate and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps intended for labelling consumer packaged tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, and cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="727">Excise stamp users who wish to take off excise stamps according to the “new system” have to file a request with the customs office to have excise stamps issued electronically.</seg>
<seg id="728">Excise stamp users have to use the electronic excise stamp system not only to request that excise stamps be issued electronically, but also to report data required under Slovak national legislation and to keep a record of excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="729">Excise stamps may only be printed by the state enterprise Mincovňa Kremnica, štátny podnik (the Kremnica Mint).</seg>
<seg id="730">The FD SR performs fiscal supervision over the handing of excise stamps and their destruction at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="731">The FD SR is obliged to arrange for the presence of one of its employee at the printing house during handling of the excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="732">The FD SR arranges the sale of excise stamps to excise stamp users at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="733">It is possible to take off excise stamps only from the Financial Directorate employee at the printing house.</seg>
<seg id="734">Tax warehouse keepers or tobacco product importers can affix excise stamps to consumer packaged tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="735">Tax warehouse keepers, tobacco product importers, or authorised consignees can affix excise stamps to consumer packaged cigars or cigarillos.</seg>
<seg id="736">Only an excise stamp with the symbol indicating the valid excise duty rate can be used to label consumer packaged tobacco, cigars, and cigarillos.</seg>
<seg id="737">Labelling of consumer packaged cigarettes with excise stamps may only be carried out by the company that manufactured the cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="738">No fewer than 500 excise stamps, or a multiple thereof, may be ordered.</seg>
<seg id="739">The customs office will notify the excise stamp user electronically about the number of excise stamps that he may collect, the price of the excise stamps, and the bank account number of the FD SR no later than within three working days.</seg>
<seg id="740">The customs office may reduce the number of ordered excise stamps if circumstances arise based on which it can be reasonable assumed that a breach of legal regulations might occur.</seg>
<seg id="741">The FD SR determines the deadline for the excise stamp user to collect the stamps, but no later than within 10 working days.</seg>
<seg id="742">The FD SR will inform the excise stamp user through the electronic excise stamp system about the deadline for collecting the excise stamps.</seg>
<seg id="743">The FD SR hands over the excise stamps to excise stamp users only at the printing house against receipt of the funds corresponding to the price of the stamps specified in the electronic notification from the customs office.</seg>
<seg id="744">Excise stamp users are obliged to keep record of excise stamps in the electronic excise stamp system separately for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="745">Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)</seg>
<seg id="746">In accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and Excise Duty System Department of the Excise Duty Section of the Financial Directorate is responsible for arranging the exchange of information based on requests for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the respective financial administration bodies.</seg>
<seg id="747">Such requests pertain chiefly to verifying entities in connection with excise duty administration, obtaining information regarding excise duty administration, and confirming information from the SEED database.</seg>
<seg id="748">Information is exchanged electronically through EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="749">The following is included in administrative cooperation with EU Member States: Requesting administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on excise duty administration, request for confirmation of registration in SEED); Responding to requests for administrative cooperation; Spontaneous information; Reports of events; Reports on controls.</seg>
<seg id="750">Comparison and assessment</seg>
<seg id="751">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="752">Authorisation and registration</seg>
<seg id="753">In Slovakia, constant fiscal supervision is applied to alcohol tax warehouses; in the Czech Republic, this supervision is substituted by constant supervision by the excise duty administrator through a camera surveillance system.</seg>
<seg id="754">In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouses; in Slovakia, the excise duty administrator only registers them.</seg>
<seg id="755">Slovakia has the concept of registered consignor; in the Czech Republic, it is included among tax warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="756">In Slovakia, it is possible to distil up to 43l of ethyl alcohol at the reduced excise duty rate in the case of fruit growers’ distillation.</seg>
<seg id="757">In comparison, the Czech Republic allows only 30 l of ethyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="758">Growers’ distilleries in Slovakia must have a permit not only from the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, but also from the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="759">In the Czech Republic, growers’ distilleries only need a permit from the Ministry of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="760">In Slovakia, consumer packaged alcohol can only be imported by tax warehouse keepers and importers of consumer packaged alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="761">An importer permit is conditional upon registration of the applicant with the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="762">In the Czech Republic, importing consumer packaged alcohol needs no special permit from the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="763">In Slovakia, the sale of consumer packaged alcohol requires a sales permit issued by the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="764">Sellers of consumer packaged alcohol have the legal obligation to keep a record of purchases and sales.</seg>
<seg id="765">In the Czech Republic, the excise duty administrator does not issue any permits to final sellers of consumer packaged alcohol: it is sufficient for them to have a licence to sell alcohol from the Trade Licensing Office. The final seller keeps no special records.</seg>
<seg id="766">In Slovakia, motor fuel merchants must have the respective sales permit from the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="767">Slovak law has no special regulation governing service stations. All activities pertaining to service stations are only regulated in the Act on Excise Duty on Mineral Oils.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the Czech Republic, service stations are regulated by the Act on Motor Fuels. The excise duty administrator, however, issues no licences to sell motor fuels.</seg>
<seg id="769">Service stations are registered and the Ministry of Industry and Trade publishes their list.</seg>
<seg id="770">In Slovakia, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of service stations from the financial administration system.</seg>
<seg id="771">In Slovakia, there has been a sharp rise in the number of various permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="772">This increase was caused by a legislative change in the mentioned period.</seg>
<seg id="773">In the Czech Republic, however, the number of permits fell substantially in 2013 due to the introduction of a guarantee for motor fuel distributors.</seg>
<seg id="774">Administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="775">In Slovakia, substantive law regulations lay down the obligation to perform tax audits at various tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="776">This issue is addressed in more detail by the internal regulation issued by the FD SR to unify the excise duty administration procedure in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="777">In the Czech Republic, substantive law regulations do not regulate the obligation to perform tax audits; procedural regulations only state the possibility to perform a tax audit no later than by the duty assessment deadline.</seg>
<seg id="778">The reason for the major difference in the number of conducted tax audits and on-site inspections in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic is the fact that the internal regulation of the FD SR stipulates the cases where the excise duty administrator has to perform a tax audit and the respective deadlines, whereas in the Czech Republic, on-site inspections are the main tools used to check the accuracy of excise declarations or excise duty refund claims.</seg>
<seg id="779">The number of comparable administrative tasks in the Czech Republic grew in 2012 as a result of an increase in the number of movements in EMCS and in the number of tax declarations filed.</seg>
<seg id="780">In Slovakia, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 grew slightly, a trend that was influenced by the growing number of movements in EMCS and a concurrent decrease in the number of excise returns filed.</seg>
<seg id="781">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="782">Different legal regulations resulted in major differences in the number of comparable authorisations and registrations of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="783">The number of comparable administrative tasks by excise duty administrators in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic were similar in each of the audited years.</seg>
<seg id="784">In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, of which there is one-third fewer than in the Czech Republic, shares almost the same number of administrative tasks.</seg>
<seg id="785">Based on the above, it can be said that Slovakia is focused more on excise duty administrators carrying out administrative tasks, such as physical fiscal supervision.</seg>
<seg id="786">In the Czech Republic, greater emphasis is placed on remote supervision, e.g., through camera surveillance systems, immediate dispatch of data through a web interface, and a risk analysis.</seg>
<seg id="787">Computerisation of administrative tasks</seg>
<seg id="788">Computerisation of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="789">The excise declaration can be filed via data box.</seg>
<seg id="790">The Czech Customs Administration introduced interactive excise declaration forms, which, however cannot be further processed by computer.</seg>
<seg id="791">Furthermore, the data has to be rewritten to the tax entity’s tax account.</seg>
<seg id="792">The benefit of this system is a reduction of errors in filed excise declarations, which reduces the number of tasks that need to be performed by excise duty administrators to manage errors in incorrectly filed excise declarations.</seg>
<seg id="793">The GDC is working on a new application for computerising the excise declaration processing.</seg>
<seg id="794">Through the intelligent forms, it is also possible to: file excise duty or registration applications or notifications of changes to data; file excise duty refund claims; satisfy the notification requirement related to handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco, and satisfying biofuel-related obligations.</seg>
<seg id="795">Handling excise stamps is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebKlient information system, which is available to registered tax entities to enter data required by the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="796">Products under duty suspension can be moved in the Czech Republic based on an electronic accompanying document, which, in the Czech Republic, is implemented as a national functionality in the electronic excise movement and control system (EMCS).</seg>
<seg id="797">Products in free circulation can move around the fiscal territory of the Czech Republic accompanied by a document proving their taxation, a duty exemption document, a customs office decision on release of products into the customs regime, a simplified accompanying document, or other decision on excise duty assessment.</seg>
<seg id="798">The required content of the data is laid down in legal regulations.</seg>
<seg id="799">To facilitate the satisfaction of these obligations, the Czech Republic implemented a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="800">This system allows paper documents to be replaced or supplemented with electronically issued documents that are sent via the Czech Customs Administration web interface to a data repository, where a unique 12-digit identification code (UIC) is allocated.</seg>
<seg id="801">The UIC is used by the customs authorities for control purposes on the road and makes it impossible for goods to be moved again using the same document.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Czech Customs Administration has online access to the electronic recordkeeping system of the biggest warehouse keeper for motor fuel in the Czech Republic, who places about half of the total volume of motor fuel into free circulation and who automatically enters the issued tax documents into this system.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Czech Customs Administration is considering implementing e-VDO, i.e., an electronic system for recording and monitoring the movement of various products in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="804">This system should make use of 70% of existing EMCS functional specifications.</seg>
<seg id="805">A benefit of this system will be a user-friendly environment for declarants and customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="806">It will also be connected to the guarantee management system, the Tax Entities Register, and the risk analysis system (ERIAN).</seg>
<seg id="807">The system should provide an overview of movements in free circulation between Member States, which at present is functioning based on paper documents without a record or exchange of the reference numbers of the simplified accompanying documents.</seg>
<seg id="808">Misuse of the simplified accompanying document, repeated use of a single document, and illegal transport without any documents are the main risks of the current approach to recording the movements of products in free circulation.</seg>
<seg id="809">Computerisation of administrative tasks in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="810">During excise duty administration, the Slovak Financial Administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods under duty suspension in EMCS, excise stamps, and the submission of excise declarations, and to register and record tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2014, one-way communication of tax entities with the excise duty administrator was also introduced and then, in 2016, expanded to allow two-way communication.</seg>
<seg id="812">Under this electronic communication system, a tax entity, after entering login data, has access to its personal web zone, called a personal electronic mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="813">In this zone, a tax entity has access to an electronic mailroom, through which it sends requests, notifications, tax declarations, and other documents pertaining to excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="814">Electronic communication via the personal web zone does not involve all tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="815">National legislation defines the tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the excise duty administrator electronically.</seg>
<seg id="816">This pertains mainly to VAT payers, tax advisors representing tax entities, and lawyers representing tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="817">During the audit, the Slovak SAO also addressed the questions of the computerisation extent of excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="818">This pertained also to full computerisation of tasks – excise declarations and electronic communication within ELO.</seg>
<seg id="819">Apart from movements in EMCS, there was an increase in computerisation of various comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement of modern excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="820">Comparison and assessment</seg>
<seg id="821">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="822">In Slovakia, the excise declaration procedure is fully computerised from the submission of the excise declaration to the recording of the excise obligation.</seg>
<seg id="823">In the Czech Republic, a computerised excise declaration procedure is not available.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Czech Republic, tax entities may upload mandatory documents for each movement in free circulation onto a website.</seg>
<seg id="825">Notifications of movements in free circulation in the form and on the basis of EMCS are being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="826">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="827">The system for reporting movements in free circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to fiscal supervision, thereby eliminating the movement of certain products for which excise duty has not been paid.</seg>
<seg id="828">This can be recommended as a good practice.</seg>
<seg id="829">Computerisation of the excise declaration procedure has shown to be a good practice in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="830">The Slovak SAO and the Czech SAO therefore recommend completion of the computerisation of the excise declaration procedure in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="831">Analysis of changes to the organisational structure and staffing in the area of excise duties</seg>
<seg id="832">The organisational structure of the Czech Customs Administration and the Slovak Financial Administration has undergone fundamental changes.</seg>
<seg id="833">Organisational structure of the Czech Customs Administration</seg>
<seg id="834">Effective of 1 January 2013, the Czech Customs Administration comprises the General Directorate of Customs and the customs offices, which are administrative authorities and branches of the government.</seg>
<seg id="835">The Czech Customs Administration is the accounting entity for the entire customs administration.</seg>
<seg id="836">The Czech Customs Administration has conducted comprehensive excise duty administration since 2004 as one of its many responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="837">The Czech Customs Administration is also responsible for the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="838">a) Audits and inspections:</seg>
<seg id="839">Road transport (weighing of freight vehicles, payment of road tolls, fulfilment of conditions for transporting hazardous goods, expert supervision of vehicle crews in international road freight transport, and in matters pertaining to international passenger transport);</seg>
<seg id="840">Handling of waste and packaging material;</seg>
<seg id="841">Safety of imported food;</seg>
<seg id="842">Consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights;</seg>
<seg id="843">Employment of foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="844">b)Customs administration – comprehensive application of customs regulations, commercial policy measures, and formalities in connection with importing and exporting goods</seg>
<seg id="845">c) Collection and enforcement of monetary obligations imposed by other public authorities as part of shared administration</seg>
<seg id="846">d)Activities of the police authorities (authorised customs authorities) in criminal proceedings related to violation of customs and related regulations and tax regulations when the Czech Customs Administration is the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="847">Although the range of competencies (combination of control activities) increases spending for the Czech Customs Administration, savings are incurred on the scope, as public administration does not need to expend costs on creating control teams for each subject of control.</seg>
<seg id="848">At the same time, the administrative burden for inspected parties subject to re-audit is being reduced.</seg>
<seg id="849">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="850">As part of the Modernisation of the Czech Customs Administration project, on 1 January 2013, the Czech Customs Administration changed from a three-level structure to a two-level one, eliminating the middle level (customs directorates).</seg>
<seg id="851">The GDC spent about CZK 51,000,000 (about € 2,031,000) on the project.</seg>
<seg id="852">As of 1 January 2013, the Czech Customs Administration has comprised the General Directorate of Customs and the regional customs offices, which are administrative authorities and branches of the government.</seg>
<seg id="853">The customs offices and their responsibilities are laid down in the law, and all customs offices through their departments and local branches carry out excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="854">Local branches are the internal organisational units of the customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="855">Establishing and winding up local branches and determining their responsibilities is in the remit of the Ministry of Finance, which issues decrees in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="856">Legal regulations do not lay down any responsibilities on the local branches – they act in the name and on behalf of the customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="857">Organisational structure until 31 Dec. 2012</seg>
<seg id="858">Organisational structure since 1 January 2013</seg>
<seg id="859">Until 31 December 2012, excise duty administration was performed by the General Directorate of Customs, 8 customs directorates and 58 customs office departments (including branches), i.e., a total of 67 divisions and departments.</seg>
<seg id="860">On 1 January 2016, excise duty administration was carried out by the General Directorate of Customs and 51 departments of the customs offices and their local branches, 8 offices of the Legal Section of the General Directorate of Customs, and customs office divisions providing mobile supervision, i.e., about 60 locations.</seg>
<seg id="861">Spending by the Czech Customs Administration is affected most by payroll expenses.</seg>
<seg id="862">Due to the reorganisation of the Czech Customs Administration, there were no savings on human resources.</seg>
<seg id="863">Most of the work is undertaken by customs officers employed under the Act on the Service of Security Force Members.</seg>
<seg id="864">The possibility to reduce the numbers of these officers is very limited in the Czech Republic, as pursuant to Section 42(1) of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, it is possible to dismiss an officer only under certain conditions. The law provides and exhaustive list of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="865">The reduction of positions due to organisation changes in security forces is not a reason to dismiss officers, and the employer is obliged to transfer them to corresponding positions within the forces or arrange positions at other security forces (e.g., the Czech Police, Czech Prison Service); alternatively, they are made temporary reserve officers during which time they collect in accordance with law 80% of their average service income.</seg>

<seg id="868">As part of its Policy Statement for 2012 to 2016, the Slovak Government listed as one of its priorities the completion of excise duty administration reforms through the UNITAS programme, and by unifying the collection of tax, customs, and levies and supressing tax evasion, it will obtain sufficient budgetary resources.</seg>
<seg id="869">In this context, the tax reform took place on the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Slovak Tax Directorate and the Slovak Customs Directorate into the FD SR and the creation of the financial administration.</seg>
<seg id="870">On 1 January 2012, Act No 333/2011 Coll., on governmental agencies for taxes, fees and customs, as amended, established the FD SR as a state-funded organisation with its registered office in Banská Bystrica. It is included in the state budget through the budgetary heading of the Slovak Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="871">The FD SR, the customs offices, and the Financial Administration Criminal Office are, pursuant to Act No 199/2004 Coll., on customs and on amendment to certain acts, as amended, customs authorities who fulfil their tasks according to customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="872">In accordance with Act No 333/2011 Coll., on governmental agencies for taxes and fees and customs, as amended, they constitute the financial administration along with the tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="873">As of 1 January 2012, the new organisational structure has comprised the FD SR, the Financial Administration Criminal Office, the Financial Operations Competence Centre, the tax offices, the Specialised Tax Office, tax office branches, tax office contact points, customs offices, customs office branches (CO tax branch, CO combined branch, CO customs branch) and customs office stations.</seg>
<seg id="874">The FD SR’s mission is the effective collection and administration of taxes and customs, i.e., including excise duties, to fulfil the revenue portion of the state budget and protect the economic interests of the state.</seg>
<seg id="875">The President of the Financial Administration of Slovakia, who is appointed and recalled by the Slovak Minister of Finance, is the governing body of the FD SR.</seg>
<seg id="876">The President of the Financial Administration is responsible to the Minister of Finance for all financial administration operations and, thereby, even for the activities of the FD SR, which he manages and represents in full.</seg>
<seg id="877">The short form of the organisational structure as at 1 January 2012:</seg>
<seg id="878">Excise duty administration activities and processes in Slovakia are the responsibility of the customs office branches (38 branches), customs office stations (18 stations), the excise duty departments (9 departments) and legal support departments (9 departments).</seg>
<seg id="879">Comparison of the total number of financial administration employees involved in excise duty administration shows a slight downward trend in the number of such employees.</seg>
<seg id="880">Employee numbers differ not only between units, but also year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="881">This is mainly due to the number of systemised positions per organisational unit and due to the number of excise duty administrations managing the individual customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="882">The number of managers in financial administration is based on service requirements, especially in connection with the creation of new organisational units.</seg>
<seg id="883">Comparison and assessment</seg>
<seg id="884">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="885">Within the organisational structure of the Slovak Financial Administration, the FD SR and 74 organisational units with a total of 1,300 employees administrating almost 48,000 tax entities were involved in excise duty administration in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="886">Within the organisational structure of the Czech Customs Administration, close to 60 organisational units with a total of 1,011 employees administering about 114,000 tax entities were involved in excise duty administration in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="887">In the Czech Republic, activities related to excise duty administration are divided up across several units that are independent of each other in terms of staffing.</seg>
<seg id="888">Middle management and top management oversee their mutual coordination and cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="889">In Slovakia, activities related to excise duty administration (registration, excise declarations, tax audits) are divided between the excise duty departments and the customs office branches, where often it is the same excise duty administration employees who deal with the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="890">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="891">In Slovakia, there are about two-third fewer tax entities falling on the total number of employee involved in excise duty administration than in the Czech Republic. The greater number of employees does not appear to have an affect on the effectiveness of excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="892">EMCS system</seg>
<seg id="893">According to the preamble of the Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products, the aim of setting up a computerised system for monitoring the movement of excisable goods is to allow Member States to obtain real-time information on those movements and to carry out the requisite checks, including checks during movement of products, and allow the intra-Community movement of goods under suspension of excise duties to be simplified.</seg>
<seg id="894">When implementing this system, Member States should allow the economic operators, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises active in this sector, to use these national components at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
<seg id="895">Article three of the mentioned Decision allows national specifications, the national databases forming part of the system, and any software or equipment which a Member State considers necessary to ensure full use of the system throughout its administration to be included in EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="896">EMCS in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="897">Development and functionality of EMCS</seg>
<seg id="898">In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by the Registry of Selected Products (“Evidence vybraných výrobků” - EVV), which was in operation from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="899">EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and supplemented regularly by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).</seg>
<seg id="900">In the Czech Republic, a socalled customs module and declarant module have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="901">The customs module contains several national functionalities.</seg>
<seg id="902">Going beyond the Community system, the Czech Republic monitors through EMCS movements of goods under suspension of excise duties that start and end in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="903">Upon approval of the notice of receipt of a consignment intended for an authorised consignee for one-off acceptance, the system ensures the automatic dispatch of the information to the Tax Entities Register with subsequent invalidation of the permit.</seg>
<seg id="904">The administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including responses sent with attachments of any format, and translations are fully provided through the system.</seg>
<seg id="905">It is also possible to receive reports on the manual termination of exports in ECS (in the EU, only assignment of automatically created reports is implemented).</seg>
<seg id="906">Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming consignments are set up according to actually required criteria.</seg>
<seg id="907">EMCS does not allow approval of e-AD or receipt notification without a response to the risk profile from the respective customs authority (it is not possible to ignore a risk profile).</seg>
<seg id="908">The declarant module is available to tax entities for free in the form of a web application that users sign into using their user name and password (coordinates), which are allocated to them upon registration with the Czech Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="909">Each action pertaining to an EMCS customs module has to bear a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.</seg>
<seg id="910">The declarant module allows tax entities to enter data on commencement and termination of movements of goods under duty suspension directly; tax entities thus do not have to spend funds on purchasing a system.</seg>
<seg id="911">The national functionalities of the declarant module allow data to be opened and stored off-line (saves time in the case of frequently used data), data about recipients to be filled in based on SEED ID checks and requests for filling in data that are voluntary on the EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).</seg>
<seg id="912">The system also allows the excise guarantee in the corresponding amount to be held in respect of every consignment until its movement ends.</seg>
<seg id="913">The amount of the guarantee is calculated by EMCS automatically.</seg>
<seg id="914">Without a sufficient guarantee, it is not possible to send an e-AD proposal from the EMCS declarant module to the customs office for approval.</seg>
<seg id="915">Each guarantee has a unique number and contains the ARC of the movement (including the amount of the blocked bond) for which it was used.</seg>
<seg id="916">The tax entity can manage its guarantees in the EMCS declarant module, where it can see the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="917">Expenditure on implementing and using EMCS</seg>
<seg id="918">EMCS development was executed based on eight agreements between 2006 and 2017 worth CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e., € 1,761,412.56), excluding VAT, in total.</seg>
<seg id="919">In line with the agreements, the contractor issued invoices totalling CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e., € 1,640,401.10),5 excluding VAT, between 2006 and the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="920">In the audited period, CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e., € 547,438.99), was spent upgrading EMCS.</seg>
<seg id="921">The amount spent on upgrading EMCS in the audited period converted to one movement entered into EMCS amounts on average to CZK 16.49 (i.e., € 0.62); without national movements, spending per movement between the Czech Republic and EU Member States amounted to CZK 24.40 (i.e., € 0. 92).</seg>
<seg id="922">The technical support of EMCS was provided based in four agreements between 2011 and 2017.</seg>
<seg id="923">By the end of 2015, CZK 7,499,675 (i.e., € 281,389.77),13 including VAT, was invoiced for the technical support.</seg>
<seg id="924">The average amount paid since 2011 for the technical support per movement entered in EMCS since 2010 amounts to CZK 6.18 (i.e., € 0.23).</seg>
<seg id="925">Invoices for the development and technical support pertained to the national solutions, which led to the development of the EVV application, which the General Directorate of Customs operated before EMCS was launched.</seg>
<seg id="926">The invoices were paid from national sources under programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="927">Technical support is invoiced as part of services to other applications provided by the supplier to the Czech Customs Administration.</seg>
<seg id="928">EMCS in Slovakia</seg>
<seg id="929">EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System) is an electronic system operated by the EU Member States for the purpose of monitoring the movement of excisable goods under duty suspension between Member States.</seg>
<seg id="930">It replaced the accompanying document that was used before this system came into effect, thereby ensuring better checks and supervision of movements.</seg>
<seg id="931">EMCS was launched in Slovakia on 1 April 2010 and is updated regularly based on requirements stemming from EU legislation.</seg>
<seg id="932">A unique administrative reference code, ARC, is generated for each movement.</seg>
<seg id="933">This code is used to monitor movements on-line, i.e., in real time.</seg>

<seg id="936">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="937">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="938">EMCS was implemented as another module of SysNeD application software. For this reason, the Slovak side cannot determine the costs of its first application.</seg>
<seg id="939">Comparison and assessment</seg>
<seg id="940">Comparison</seg>
<seg id="941">The objective of EMCS was to replace a system based on movement administration in paper form.</seg>
<seg id="942">The benefit of EMCS is a complex overview of transport between EU Member States, from notification of when transport begins up to when it ends. Another important aspect is the reduction of administrative costs spent by the excise duty administrator and tax entities on processing, submitting and storing documents.</seg>
<seg id="943">In the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, national functionalities have been implemented into EMCS to allow surveillance of movement of goods under duty suspension between two spots in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="944">Moreover, in the Czech Republic, the automatic functionalities of on-line monitoring and securing the excise bond has been added.</seg>
<seg id="945">National functionalities that monitor the risk profile of the tax entity or movement, with a subsequent mandatory response form the excise duty administrator, have also been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="946">EMCS shows that Slovakia and the Czech Republic have comparable number of movements within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="947">Between 2012 and 2015, Slovakia spent € 744,310.01 more that the Czech Republic upgrading this system.</seg>
<seg id="948">The Slovak SAO obtained information from the FD SR about EMCS upgrades for the period since 2011 although this system was launched earlier.</seg>
<seg id="949">Despite this fact, Slovakia spent € 188,134.44 more than the Czech Republic did on implementing and upgrading EMCS over the ten years that it has been in operation there.</seg>
<seg id="950">Assessment</seg>
<seg id="951">In the audited period, the costs associated with upgrading EMCS in Slovakia per movement was 2.3 times higher than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="952">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="953">Cooperation between the Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO has satisfied its objectives.</seg>
<seg id="954">Both auditing institutions obtained greater knowledge and understanding of the excise duty administration system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="955">Despite a shared basic legal framework, the cooperation revealed significant differences between the two systems affecting the effectiveness of excise duty administration.</seg>
<seg id="956">During the parallel audits, examples of good practice were found. These could contribute to reducing tax fraud, the significance of which will grow as duty rates rise.</seg>
<seg id="957">Procedures reducing the costs of excise duty administration were also identified.</seg>
<seg id="958">Cooperation has revealed differences that significantly influence excise duty administration and hinder international comparison without mutually coordinated audits being conducted at the excise duty administrator.</seg>
<seg id="959">In this the role of the supreme audit institutions is indispensable.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist, and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all.</seg>
<seg id="2">Now, only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity; it is built into His nature.</seg>
<seg id="3">But since the time of Darwin, we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aren't we, after all, the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution?</seg>
<seg id="5">If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life, then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason, self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould to dash this flattering illusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">His credentials are excellent for the task.</seg>
<seg id="8">Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin.</seg>
<seg id="10">For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness; it is a careening, chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot.</seg>
<seg id="11">In "Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History" (Norton, 326 pages, $19.95), Mr. Gould makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution." The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world's oceans today.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="14">The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accordingly, the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof.</seg>
<seg id="17">Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.</seg>
<seg id="18">By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures, this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="19">One was so fantastic in appearance, it was dubbed Hallucigenia.</seg>
<seg id="20">Would that Mr. Gould's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful.</seg>
<seg id="21">A good deal of the book is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.</seg>
<seg id="22">These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like, "Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma."</seg>
<seg id="23">Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="25">The vast majority of them, however, were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate.</seg>
<seg id="26">Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery "in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues." So much for survival of the fittest.</seg>
<seg id="27">So much, too, for the notion that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by evolving big brains.</seg>
<seg id="28">Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small, not smart.</seg>
<seg id="29">If anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us, Mr. Gould sketches several.</seg>
<seg id="30">In one, birds are the dominant carnivores; in another the seas abound with "little penises."</seg>
<seg id="31">Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility." I, by contrast, cannot help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.</seg>
<seg id="33">But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all, the universe is a big place, and given the right conditions, sympathetic to creating some form of life.</seg>
<seg id="34">Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why, paleontologically speaking, "it is, indeed, a wonderful life."</seg>

<seg id="1">What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?</seg>
<seg id="2">This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.</seg>
<seg id="6">But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?</seg>
<seg id="7">Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.</seg>
<seg id="9">It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="10">In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.</seg>
<seg id="11">The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="14">The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.</seg>
<seg id="15">In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"</seg>
<seg id="16">Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.</seg>
<seg id="18">Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.</seg>

<seg id="1">This letter was inspired by David Asman's Sept. 25 editorial-page article about Fidel Castro, "Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking."</seg>
<seg id="2">I've organized a series of exchanges, exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists.</seg>
<seg id="3">In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity, consequently I've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists, but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite levels of obstruction, incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion, these projects all remain, in my mind, valuable and well worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is a simple reason for this: the Cuban people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those "people" to whom I refer are not some heroic, indecipherable quantity; they are artists, critics, taxi drivers, grandmothers, even some employees of the Ministry of Culture, all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution, spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society, reverence for education and creative expression, universal rights to health and livelihood, housing, etc.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara's famous linkages of art, idealism and revolution seem modest.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is on behalf of these people, and out of my real respect for them, that I am responding to Mr. Asman's opinions of their country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ochoa trial in July, with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption, and the summary trial and execution, was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, unacceptable though those occurrences may have been, they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel, the army and the Cuban people.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are not interchangeable, since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is naivete to equate a government's policies with the will of the people (as we well know), and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials, even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime, such as facilitating defections.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think it's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel doesn't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory.</seg>
<seg id="17">We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom.</seg>
<seg id="18">Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">From my own point of view, given the qualities of humanity, creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel, we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear, and which seem to run in such short supply these days.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is no rational justification for such behavior.</seg>

<seg id="1">US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary</seg>
<seg id="2">Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."</seg>
<seg id="12">Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.</seg>
<seg id="16">Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parallel audit of the administration of value-added tax and excise taxes between the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="3">The present document provides information on the execution and results of parallel audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were both focused on the area of administration of value-added lax and excise taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cooperation between the two supreme audit institutions of the two countries is based on the Agreement on Audit Cooperation, signed in February 2004.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic of the parallel audits was chosen with a view to the fact that indirect taxes constitute very substantial revenue of the state budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The value-added tax structure, which allows for a refund of an excessive tax deduction, provides room for tax frauds and tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="7">High excise tax rates, particularly those applying to tobacco and tobacco products, spirits and mineral oils, bring high profits to those who can dodge them by selling the commodities listed above illegally.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tax frauds are a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also elsewhere in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">The need to tackle the problem comprehensively and in a coordinated fashion all across (he Union prompted EU SAIs to establish a VAT Working Group, in the work of which the Supreme Audit Offices of both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most important contribution of the two audits described herein is not just the exchange of information, but particularly in joint efforts to identify problematic areas of the administration of indirect taxes in order to reduce the room for tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experience and information acquired will be used in planned audits of indirect taxes, which will focus predominantly on the involvement of tax administrators of both countries in the VIES system that permits controlling movements of goods between EU member states.</seg>
<seg id="12">Report on results of the audit of the administration of value-added tax and excise taxes in 2002 and 2003</seg>
<seg id="13">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="14">Audit IDs: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004</seg>
<seg id="15">Subject matter:</seg>
<seg id="16">(CZ) Value-added tax and excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="17">(SK) Audit of procedures employed by the tax administrator in the administration, control and collection of value-added tax and excise taxes</seg>
<seg id="18">On February 11, 2004, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter „SAO CR") and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter „SAO SR") signed an Agreement on Audit Cooperation, the subject matter of which was cooperation of the two institutions in parallel audits, namely „Value-added tax and excise taxes", included in the Audit Plan of SAO CR under ID 04/07, and „Audit of procedures employed by the tax administrator in the administration, control and collection of value-added tax and excise taxes", included in the Audit Plan of SAO SR under ID 18/2004.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information, the scope of which has been defined in the Agreement referred to above, and in the preparation of a joint final report on audit results.</seg>
<seg id="20">Under the Agreement, both parties have undertaken to exchange information from their respective public sources, custom administration databases and files of taxpaying entities maintained by tax offices in the Czech Republic and tax offices in the Slovak Republic, which the parties were unable to obtain for the purpose of auditing the application of value-added tax and excise taxes from sources in their own territory.</seg>
<seg id="21">The audits were conducted in parallel, from January to August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="22">Insofar as the Czech Republic (hereinafter „CR") is concerned, the audit was performed by SAO's State Budget Department and Regional Offices in South Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The audited entities included the General Directorate of Customs and twelve selected Tax Offices: Tax Office of Praha 1, Tax Office of Praha 3, Tax Office of České Budějovice, Tax Office of Frýdek-Místek, Tax Office of Hodonín, Tax Office of Jihlava, Tax Office of Kostelec nad Orlicí, Tax Office of Kroměříž, Tax Office of Písek, Tax Office of Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Tax Office of Ústí nad Orlicí, Tax Office of Velké Meziříčí.</seg>
<seg id="24">Insofar as the Slovak Republic (hereinafter „SR") is concerned, the audit was performed by SAO SR's Section of Tax and Customs Administration in cooperation with SAO's Regional Offices in Banska Bystrica and Kosice.</seg>
<seg id="25">The audited entities included ten selected Tax Offices: Tax Office for selected taxpayers in Bratislava, Tax Office of Bratislava III, Tax Office of Trnava, Tax Office of Púchov, Tax Office of Banska Bystrica I, Tax Office of Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax Office of Žilina I, Tax Office of Žilina II, Tax Office of Košice I and Tax Office of Kosice IV.</seg>
<seg id="26">Audit objective</seg>
<seg id="27">The purpose of the audits was to check and verify the performance of Tax Offices and Customs Offices with respect to the administration of value-added and excise taxes, with an emphasis on the collection of these taxes in connection with exports and imports of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purpose of the international cooperation under the Agreement referred to above was to check export and import transactions of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, using the Customs Databases of the two countries, and to make their subsequent verification using Tax Return Forms submitted to relevant Tax Offices of jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="29">The audits covered the years 2002 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="30">2. Summary of Audit Results</seg>
<seg id="31">2.1. General Assessment of the Audits</seg>
<seg id="32">Under the International Cooperation Agreement referred to above, the Czech Supreme Audit Office handed over 22,206 items of Single Administrative Documents (hereinafter „SAD") on export and import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic from the Czech Customs Database to its Slovak counterpart. On the other hand, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office provided 30,221 items of Single Administrative Documents from the Slovak Customs Database to its Czech counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="33">A comparison of selected SAD items from the Czech Customs Database and the Slovak Customs Database was made.</seg>
<seg id="34">The total number of SAD items selected from the Czech Customs Database was 5,883, of which 43 percent were assigned to a transaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">The total number of SAD items selected from the Slovak Customs Database was 12,343, of which 26 percent were assigned to a transaction.</seg>
<seg id="36">Based on the remaining, i.e. unassigned, SAD items, a selection of folders of taxpaying entities was made at Tax Offices, in respect whereof export and import transactions were further verified in cooperation with the Czech and Slovak Customs Directorates.</seg>
<seg id="37">The information provided by the Czech and Slovak Customs Directorates and Tax Offices and exchanged between the two states was used to check whether registered export and import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic had indeed taken place.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices conducted a joint pilot audit at the Starý Hrozenkov Drietoma border checkpoint, during which both parties were cooperating very closely to verify data on movements of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The audit did not identify any shortfalls or deficiencies in records of selected export and import transactions, which had taken place in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="40">The international cooperation described herein made it possible to check and verify business transactions between partners from both nations, and has helped identify shortfalls and deficiencies in records of export and import transactions.</seg>
<seg id="41">2.2. Summary of Audit Results</seg>
<seg id="42">Under the International Cooperation Agreement referred to above, the audit carried out by the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices focused on exports and imports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, cellphones and their components, and other goods.</seg>
<seg id="43">Based on a check of folders of taxpaying entities at selected Tax Offices, the Czech Supreme Audit Office asked for a verification of exports of goods registered on 40 SAD s, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 15,301,093,-, while the Slovak Supreme Audit Office asked for a verification of exports of goods the aggregate statistical value of which was 56,989 SKK.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices have established, inter alia, the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="45">- Business transactions were not declared in the same way in both countries, which made corresponding exports and imports difficult to identity in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases,</seg>
<seg id="46">- Data entry errors in the above-mentioned customs databases made it impossible to identify some import and export transactions,</seg>
<seg id="47">- Some exports from the Czech Republic failed to find and verify appropriate matching imports in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="48">Insofar as these cases are concerned, there exists a justified suspicion of fictitious exports for the purpose of illegally claiming a value-added tax return,</seg>
<seg id="49">- Taxpaying entities failed to comply with certain legal obligations pertaining to the reporting of exports and imports in value-added tax return forms,</seg>
<seg id="50">- Shortfalls and deficiencies were identified in the administration of value-added tax and excise taxes by Tax Offices and in their coordination with customs offices.</seg>
<seg id="51">Insofar as value-added tax and excise taxes are concerned, continuous attention will have to be paid to international trade in order to minimize tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of particular importance is improving the work of tax administrators with respect to value-added tax.</seg>
<seg id="53">An efficient excise tax management system cannot dispense with checks of circulating documents, systematic physical checks of goods and mutual exchange of information on imported and exported goods.</seg>
<seg id="54">3. Current State of Affairs in the Area of Value-Added Tax and Excise Taxes</seg>
<seg id="55">Value-Added Tax</seg>
<seg id="56">Value-added tax (hereinafter „VAT") was collected by Tax Offices on taxable performance at home and by Customs Offices on imported goods.</seg>
<seg id="57">Tax revenues of Tax Offices are equal to the difference between the total collected VAT and VAT refunds.</seg>
<seg id="58">VAT revenues of Customs Offices are equal to the total amount of collected VAT.</seg>
<seg id="59">In accordance with basic principles of VAT, the tax collected by Customs Offices is reflected in VAT refund claims submitted to and granted by Tax Offices.</seg>
<seg id="60">For most Tax Offices, VAT refunds exceed VAT liabilities.</seg>
<seg id="61">VAT is one of the key tax revenues of the state budget, as it accounted for roughly 31 percent of the Czech Republic's budget revenues and for about 42 percent of the Slovak Republic's budget revenues in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="62">The aggregate balance of VAT in the Czech Republic in 2003 was CZK 162.9 billion.</seg>
<seg id="63">Tax and Customs Offices altogether collected CZK 394.3 billion, the aggregate amount of VAT refunds was CZK 231.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="64">The aggregate balance of VAT in the Slovak Republic in 2003 was SK 83.8 billion.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tax and Customs Offices altogether collected SK 187.0 billion, the aggregate amount of VAT refunds was SK 103.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Excise Taxes</seg>
<seg id="67">Excise taxes (hereinafter „ExT“) were collected by appropriate Tax Offices; insofar as imports of products subject to excise tax were concerned, ExT were collected by Customs Offices.</seg>
<seg id="68">ExT accounted for roughly 16 percent of the Czech Republic's budget revenues and for about 19 percent of the Slovak Republic's budget revenues in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="69">The aggregate ExT balance collected by Tax Offices and Customs Offices in 2003 was CZK 85.6 billion in the Czech Republic and SK 38.0 billion in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="70">4. Audit Execution</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation between the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices took place in two phases.</seg>
<seg id="72">The first phase comprised a comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities on the basis of data obtained from the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases. The second phase consisted in a mutual verification of selected business transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, and checks performed in the territory of each of the countries.</seg>
<seg id="73">4.1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Audit preparations</seg>
<seg id="75">The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and ExT audits was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices in April 2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">In November 2003, there was a coordination meeting, which brought, inter alia, an agreement regarding the commodities to be audited, i.e. types of goods posing a high risk of non-compliance with customs and tax regulations: - alcohol and spirits, Customs Tariff Headings No. 2207 and No. 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, Customs Tariff Headings No. 2401, No. 2402 and No. 2403, - computers and computer components, Customs Tariff Headings and Sub-Headings No. 8471 and No. 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, Customs Tariff Sub-Headings No. 8525 20 91, No. 8525 20 99 and No. 8529 90 40.</seg>
<seg id="77">Both parties agreed that the selection of taxpaying entities to be checked would be made: a) From unassigned items resulting from a comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, b) From entities regularly involved in export or import transactions or involved in a one-off large export or import transaction, c) On the basis of findings of checks and audits performed by selected Tax Offices.</seg>
<seg id="78">4.2. Comparison of Customs Databases of the Czech and Slovak Republics</seg>
<seg id="79">In the first phase, a mechanism of mutual assignment and matching of SAD items in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases was tested on a sample of export and import transactions of selected commodities from October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="80">Next, exports of the following selected commodities (see the list below, including the Customs Tariff Classification) from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa in 2002 were compared.</seg>
<seg id="81">- 2207 Ethyl alcohol, non-denatured, with volume content of alcohol equal to 80 percent or more; ethyl alcohol and other denatured distillates irrespective of their alcohol content,</seg>
<seg id="82">- 2208 Ethyl alcohol, non-denatured, with volume content of alcohol less than 80 percent, distillates, liqueurs and other spirit-containing beverages,</seg>
<seg id="83">- 2401 Raw tobacco; tobacco waste,</seg>
<seg id="84">- 2402 Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes made from tobacco or tobacco substitutes,</seg>
<seg id="85">- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenized or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco concentrates and essences,</seg>
<seg id="86">- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus: For cellular networks (mobile phones),</seg>
<seg id="87">- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus: Others,</seg>
<seg id="88">- 8529 90 40 Parts and components suitable for use solely or primarily with apparatus falling under headings 8525 to 8528</seg>
<seg id="89">Others: Parts and components of apparatus falling under subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.</seg>
<seg id="90">SAD items from the Customs Databases of the Czech and Slovak Republics were mutually assigned on the basis of matching contents of different columns of the SAD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, license plate number of the vehicle carrying the consignment, border crossing date, Customs Tariff heading etc.).</seg>
<seg id="91">Results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and charts.</seg>
<seg id="92">The process of matching individual export and import transactions was complicated, inter alia, by the fact that export and import transactions had not been declared by the parties in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="93">So, for example, a Czech export transaction made use of a single SAD, while the corresponding import transaction on the Slovak side made use of multiple SADs, there were differences in the numbers of items between an export SAD and its matching import SAD etc.</seg>
<seg id="94">Additional factors affecting the rate of success of the matching or assignment process was the structure of data in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases, as well as the period of time elapsed between the registration of an export transaction in the Customs Database of one country and the registration of the corresponding import transaction in the Customs Database of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="95">Results of the comparison were used to select check samples at audited Tax Offices.</seg>
<seg id="96">Attention was focused on some taxpaying entities that had accomplished export or import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which were impossible to identify in both national Customs Databases.</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, some other taxpaying entities, in respect whereof data on export or import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was found in both national Customs Databases, were selected for the purpose of verification of business operations shown in Value-Added Tax Return Forms.</seg>
<seg id="98">4.3. Pilot Audit at the Stary Hrozenkov - Drietoma Border Checkpoint</seg>
<seg id="99">The border checkpoint for the pilot audit was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned SAD items in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases.</seg>
<seg id="100">Based on a bilateral agreement between Czech and Slovak customs authorities, the use of so-called control forms was introduced at Czech-Slovak border checkpoints as of June 1,1998.</seg>
<seg id="101">The purpose of the measure was to minimize customs and tax evasion, obtain an idea of movements of vehicles transporting business goods in the customs area, and provide prerequisites for a mutual comparison of customs records.</seg>
<seg id="102">The pilot audit took place between March 8 and March 26, 2004, and its purpose was to verify the customs check procedure described above.</seg>
<seg id="103">Procedure involving the use off control forms at the Stary Hrozenkov—Drietoma border checkpoint</seg>
<seg id="104">1) Weighing of the vehicle, issue of the control form to the driver.</seg>
<seg id="105">2) Parking of the Vehicle in the assigned sector of the parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customs clearing procedure in the customs clearance building - Czech Police, Slovak Police, Czech Customs, Slovak Customs.</seg>
<seg id="107">Each authority participating In the clearance procedure will stamp the control form.</seg>
<seg id="108">3) Arrival of the vehicle to the physical inspection area.</seg>
<seg id="109">Presentation of the control form, SAD and other relevant documents to the customs officer. A check of all required steps and documents.</seg>

<seg id="111">Release of the vehicle from the customs zone.</seg>
<seg id="112">Note: Vehicles carrying goods imported to the Czech Republic were weighed by Czech customs officers.</seg>
<seg id="113">Vehicles carrying goods imported to the Slovak Republic were Weighed by employees of an authorized legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="114">Weighed vehicles were entered into a computer database</seg>
<seg id="115">4.3.1 Audit Sample</seg>
<seg id="116">Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="117">The audit sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records of the Czech Customs Database of exports in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="118">The composition of the audit sample for export transactions is shown in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="119">4.3.2. Control Forms and their Registration Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="120">Insofar as exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were concerned, the control forms were issued and registered by the Slovak Customs Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="121">The Czech Customs Directorate recorded registration numbers of the control forms pertaining to exported goods in its electronic database of exports.</seg>
<seg id="122">Of the total number of 453 SAD items, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 256 imports to the Slovak Republic on the basis of data from the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases, and the remaining 197 SAD items in cooperation with customs officers of the Drietoma border checkpoint.</seg>
<seg id="123">Exports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="124">Insofar as exports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic were concerned, the control forms were issued and registered by the Czech Customs Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="125">Of the total number of 339 SAD items, the Czech Supreme Audit Office assigned corresponding control form registration numbers to 295 in cooperation with customs officers of the Stary Hrozenkov border checkpoint.</seg>
<seg id="126">The remaining 44 SAD items were identified and the exports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic confirmed by customs officers of the Drietoma border checkpoint.</seg>
<seg id="127">The audit conducted by the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices did not identify any shortfalls or deficiencies in records and registration procedures pertaining to selected exports and imports of goods going through the Stary Hrozenkov -Drietoma border checkpoint in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="128">4.4. Selected Audit Findings Established in the Course of Verification of Business Transactions</seg>
<seg id="129">The purpose of the international cooperation project was to verify import and export transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, using data provided by the Customs Directorate and Tax Offices, whichever is applicable, in the territory of the other country.</seg>
<seg id="130">For selected taxpaying entities, the following facts were checked:</seg>
<seg id="131">- Whether submitted SADs had been registered in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases,</seg>
<seg id="132">- Whether legal requirements applying to the deduction of VAT with respect to imported goods, to VAT refund or VAT exemption with respect to exported goods had been complied with.</seg>

<seg id="169">- It was not possible to find matching import SADs for 2 export SADs registered in the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 293,024.-, in the Slovak Customs Database (see Paragraphs 6 and 7 above).</seg>
<seg id="170">Because of some errors in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered import transactions, e.g. when the importer's name was missing or if there was a mistake in the Tax Identification Number (hereinafter „Tax ID").</seg>
<seg id="171">Consequently, it is not possible to say with certainty that the import transactions had not actually taken place.</seg>
<seg id="172">- For 4 export SADs from the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 399,776., no matching imports were found and proven (see Paragraph 5 above).</seg>
<seg id="173">In this case, there exists a suspicion of a fictitious export of goods for the purpose of placing an unjustifiable and illegal VAT refund claim.</seg>
<seg id="174">5. Audit of Exports and Imports of Goods and Services at Selected Tax offices</seg>
<seg id="175">5.1. Audit Sample</seg>
<seg id="176">Folders of taxpaying entities were selected at Tax Offices being audited for the purpose of verifying whether taxpaying entities comply with their obligations with respect to exports and imports of goods and services, and assessing the cooperation between financial and customs authorities. The selection was based on the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="177">1. The criteria used to select taxpayers from the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases were as follows: a) Highest volume of imports, b) Highest assessed VAT, c) Highest volume of exports,</seg>
<seg id="178">2. The criteria used to select taxpayers from records of Tax Offices were as follows: a) Amount of VAT refund claims related to imports, b) Excessive VAT refund claims, c) ExT refund claims, d) VAT exemption on exports,</seg>
<seg id="179">3. Taxpaying entities that had undergone a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="180">The sample selection did not take into account the country of destination and was focused on risky commodities.</seg>
<seg id="181">5.2. Audit Findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="182">A list of imports and exports of risky commodities to and from the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="183">5.2.1. Audit of the Selected Sample at Tax Offices</seg>
<seg id="184">In its audit of Tax Offices, the Czech Supreme Audit Office focused particularly on the following issues:</seg>
<seg id="185">- Procedures employed by Tax Offices to check VAT values shown in VAT Return Forms,</seg>
<seg id="186">- Cooperation between Tax Offices and customs authorities,</seg>
<seg id="187">- A comparison of data from the Customs Database with that from the SAD databases of Tax Offices, focusing on a comparison of declared values, application of appropriate VAT rates (according to the Customs Tariff classification of the goods or service in question), and possibly also a comparison of data on SADs and accompanying invoices with that from the Customs Database,</seg>
<seg id="188">- A comparison of data from VAT Return Forms pertaining to export- and import-related payments and goods with data in SAD databases at Tax Offices or in the Customs Database,</seg>
<seg id="189">- The manner of verification of claims for VAT exemption with respect to exported goods or services,</seg>
<seg id="190">- A comparison of the volumes of exported goods or services according to VAT Return Forms against corresponding data in the Customs Database.</seg>
<seg id="191">The SAD databases at Tax Offices contained only records on import and export transactions in respect whereof the taxpayer was obliged to mention the transaction in the tax return form.</seg>
<seg id="192">The audit carried out at the Tax Offices focused on files of taxpaying entities, whose 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms had shown imports in an aggregate value of CZK 60,396,379,000.-, and the corresponding VAT sum of CZK 12,644, 052,000.-.</seg>
<seg id="193">Furthermore, files of taxpaying entities, whose 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms had shown exports in an aggregate value of CZK 47,323,111,000.-, were also audited.</seg>
<seg id="194">According to the Czech Customs Database, the taxpayers subject to the audit of export and import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, had accomplished imports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003, whose aggregate VAT basis and VAT were CZK 3,759,352,000.-and CZK 767,607,000.-, respectively, and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic in 2002 and 2003, whose aggregate statistical value was CZK 1,989,090,000.-.</seg>
<seg id="195">The differences between records in SAD databases of Tax Offices and data from the Czech Customs Database were checked in the following manner:</seg>
<seg id="196">- SAD items, which were missing in the Czech Customs Database, were requested directly at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,</seg>
<seg id="197">-As to SAD items, which were missing in the databases of Tax Offices, a check was made to verify and establish whether they had not been destroyed or cancelled,</seg>
<seg id="198">— As to SAD items, in respect whereof differences between the Czech Customs Database and the databases of Tax Offices were found to exist, printouts of appropriate SADs, including invoices attached thereto, were requested from General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="199">The audit established, inter alia, that the SAD databases of Tax Offices did not contain, for example, records on import- and export-related related SADs corresponding to aggregate VAT values of CZK 3,622,000.- and CZK 9,359,000.-, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1.1. Differences Established by the Audit</seg>
<seg id="201">A comparison of SAD databases at Tax Offices and cumulative tax liabilities in 2002 and 2003 according to VAT Return Forms of a selected sample of taxpaying entities identified the following differences:</seg>
<seg id="202">The differences are attributable especially to:</seg>
<seg id="203">- The time difference between the physical completion of the import transaction and the date of the refund claim with respect to the VAT assessed on the imported goods.</seg>
<seg id="204">The taxpaying entity could lodge the VAT refund claim with respect to imported goods within 3 years from the end of the fiscal period in which the goods had been placed under the appropriate procedure; insofar as the temporary use procedure is concerned, within 3 years from the end of the fiscal period in which the procedure was terminated or ended.</seg>
<seg id="205">- The time difference between the physical completion of the export transaction and the date on which the taxpaying entity received the relevant SAD.</seg>
<seg id="206">The taxpaying entity was obliged to present data on accomplished export transactions exempted from VAT upon leaving the country in the VAT Return Form, at the earliest in the fiscal period in which the goods in question had left the country and subject to the taxpaying entity having received a tax document, i.e. the SAD.</seg>
<seg id="207">- Non-compliance of taxpaying entities with their duties and obligations concerning reporting of import and export transactions in their VAT Return Forms.</seg>
<seg id="208">In some cases, taxpaying entities had failed to report correct data on import and export transactions in their VAT Return Forms.</seg>
<seg id="209">As taxpaying entities did not have to attach SAD lists to their VAT Return Forms, the possibility of checking and verifying VAT refund or VAT exemption claims by Tax Offices was rendered more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="210">5.2.2. Cooperation of Tax and Customs Authorities</seg>
<seg id="211">During the period covered by the audit, customs authorities had been making decisions to return or waive import or export duties and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="212">Taxpaying entities were legally obliged to reduce their previous VAT refund claims by the amount returned by the Customs Office, and to do so in the tax return form pertaining to the fiscal period in which the tax had been returned.</seg>
<seg id="213">There was not any legal standard whatsoever which would stipulate a procedure of sending information about changes in the amounts of duties and VAT from Customs Offices to Tax Offices.</seg>
<seg id="214">It is true that some of the audited Tax Offices had been getting that information, but irregularly, or with a considerable delay, and only from some Customs Offices.</seg>
<seg id="215">One of the audited Tax Offices had not been getting that information at all.</seg>
<seg id="216">If the Tax Office did not receive the information on changes in the amounts of duties and VAT directly from the Customs Office, it did not have the data needed to check and verify compliance of taxpaying entities with their legal duties and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="217">In 2002 and 2003, the aggregate amounts of VAT returned by Customs Offices were more than CZK 319 million and more than CZK 398 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="218">Results of the audit pointed out at persisting shortfalls and deficiencies on the part of tax administrators, some system errors in cooperation between Tax Offices and customs authorities, and a failure of some taxpayers submitting VAT and ExT Return Forms to comply with their legal duties and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="219">Insofar as the administration of VAT and ExT is concerned, the audit identified particularly the following shortfalls and deficiencies:</seg>
<seg id="220">a) Insofar as cancellations of VAT registrations were concerned, the taxpayers' obligation to pay VAT on their business property that had been (or should have been) registered as of the day of the cancellation and in respect whereof the taxpayer had claimed a VAT refund had been checked only occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="221">b) Tax Offices did not make full use of a possibility to conduct a tax audit and/or local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="222">In some cases, this resulted in an inadequate verification of the eligibility or legality of VAT refund claims.</seg>
<seg id="223">c) Official records and protocols on oral proceedings did not contain all information needed to corroborate the eligibility and legality of excessive VAT refund claims.</seg>
<seg id="224">d) Tax Offices did not make sufficient and adequate checks of export and import transactions shown in VAT Return Forms.</seg>
<seg id="225">5.3. Audit Findings in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="226">5.3.1. Audit of the Selected Sample at Tax Offices</seg>
<seg id="227">The Slovak Supreme Audit Office or the Tax Office carried out a tax audit covering the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 on the selected sample.</seg>
<seg id="228">Having analyzed tax return forms and tax refund claims submitted by selected taxpayers, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office requested the Tax Office of jurisdiction to provide relevant SADs on export and import transactions, as well as invoices and documentary evidence of tax payments.</seg>
<seg id="229">Next, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office checked whether the submitted SADs had been registered in the Customs Database of import and export transactions and whether all legal requirements and conditions applying to taxation of imported goods, refund of excessive VAT, tax exemption of exported goods and refund of ExT had been complied with.</seg>
<seg id="230">The Slovak Supreme Audit Office carried out the audit at 10 Tax Offices to verify selected export and import transactions between the Czech and Slovak Republics, the structure, number of SAD items and aggregate statistical values are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="231">The aggregate statistical value of audited import transactions was SK 856.2 million, i.e. 5.11 percent of the total value of selected commodities imported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="232">The aggregate statistical value of audited export transactions involving selected commodities was SK 176 million, i.e. 6.87 percent of the total value of selected commodities exported from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">In addition, additional 618 transactions involving other goods (household appliances, packages, software) imported from EU countries to the Slovak Republic were also audited, the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 532.8 million.</seg>
<seg id="234">5.3.2. Cooperation of Tax and Customs Authorities</seg>
<seg id="235">The Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified discrepancies between data in the Slovak Customs Database and data contained in some of the audited VAT Return Forms, e.g.:</seg>
<seg id="236">- 2 taxpaying entities (natural persons) stated that they had imported goods in the value of SK 1,589,261.-, on the basis of which they had claimed a VAT refund.</seg>
<seg id="237">Following local investigations carried out at the instigation of the Slovak Supreme Audit Office, the two taxpayers could not provide any evidence supporting their refund claim (documents proving the import transactions and payment of VAT).</seg>
<seg id="238">- Another taxpaying entity (a limited liability company) had declared an accepted taxable goods valued at SK 77,167,576 and exports of goods valued at SK 18,006,041, and claimed an excessive VAT refund of SK 17,157,101.-.</seg>
<seg id="239">The 2003 VAT Return Forms indicate that the difference between the value of the purchased goods and the value of the exported goods, i.e. SK 59,161,535.-, which had been created in January 2003, was not made up for throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the cases described above, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office requested Tax Offices of jurisdiction to carry out a tax audit aimed at the excessive VAT refund claims.</seg>
<seg id="241">- In yet another case, a taxpaying entity (a limited liability company) had stated exports of goods valued at SK 87,199.- in its January to June 2002 VAT Return Forms.</seg>
<seg id="242">A check in the Slovak Customs Database showed that the total exports of the company during the period in question had amounted to SK 296,747.-.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Tax Offices of jurisdiction carried out multiple local investigations in the seat of the company, establishing that its executive secretary (a British national) had left and that the company had vacated the leased premises without terminating the Lease Contract in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="244">During the audit conducted by the Slovak Supreme Audit Office, the tax administrator notified authorities involved in criminal investigations of a suspicion of a criminal act of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="245">Based on results of the audit at selected Tax Offices, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office concludes that major problems in the exercise of administration and control of VAT and ExT occur predominantly in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="246">- The possibility to carry out a tax audit of problematic taxpayers, particularly those claiming excessive VAT refunds, has not been used often enough.</seg>
<seg id="247">- Tax audit protocols did not contain a list of audited documents</seg>
<seg id="248">- export and import SADs.</seg>
<seg id="249">- Inadequate verification of export and import transactions in tax return forms,</seg>
<seg id="250">- A lengthy decision-making process of tax administrators, in particular with respect to tax assessment proceedings, including forfeiture of the right to impose sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="251">- Failure to comply with legal requirements and conditions when granting tax payment deferments.</seg>
<seg id="252">- Failure to set off outstanding VAT payments against VAT refunds within the prescribed period of time.</seg>
<seg id="253">- Inadequate use of all forms and means of collecting and exacting outstanding tax payments.</seg>
<seg id="254">To remedy the deficiencies identified by the audit, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office has requested relevant Tax Offices to carry out a VAT audit, which should focus on eligibility and legality of excessive tax refund claims submitted by 14 taxpaying entities.</seg>
<seg id="255">Measures to remedy the deficiencies identified by the audit have been adopted at all audited Tax Offices, and the Slovak Supreme Audit Office will monitor and check their implementation.</seg>
<seg id="256">6. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="257">The international cooperation described herein has helped to verify business transactions between partners from both countries and has identified deficiencies and shortfalls in the registration of exports and imports.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition, the audits have identified persisting deficiencies in the compliance of VAT and ExT payers with their duties, in the work of Tax Offices, and in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately had an adverse impact on the efficiency and efficacy of tax audits.</seg>
<seg id="259">Lessons learnt from the audit also indicate that Czech Tax Offices have at their disposal a tax information system, which also contains essential information on export and import transactions from the Czech Customs Database, while there is no similar system permitting an exchange of information on exports and imports of goods between customs and tax authorities in the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="260">Because of different legislation and conditions existing in each of the countries, the procedure employed to audit the exercise of the administration of VAT and ExT was not identical.</seg>
<seg id="261">The Czech Supreme Audit Office used information obtained from the Czech Customs Directorate and documents available at Tax Offices being audited, while the Slovak Supreme Audit Office verified business transactions on the basis of documents of taxpaying entities requested from Tax Offices.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the event of discrepancies, it requested the Tax Office of jurisdiction to carry out a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="263">The parallel audits of VAT and ExT evaluated the situation in the administration of these taxes prior to the accession of both countries to the European Union and pointed out at the necessity of continuing cooperation in this field.</seg>
<seg id="264">Mutual cooperation will continue to expand and grow deeper with respect to audits of Tax Offices in connection with the enactment of a new VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="265">One of the new duties required with respect to deliveries of goods to other member states of the European Union is the submission of a so-called summary report.</seg>
<seg id="266">The report must be submitted by all VAT payers who have delivered goods to another EU member state and to an entity that is also a registered VAT payer in that state.</seg>
<seg id="267">Tax administrators are obliged to enter data from the summary reports to the VIES system (VAT Information Exchange System), which can be accessed by tax administrators from EU member countries.</seg>
<seg id="268">Tax Offices then can compare data from the VIES system with information presented in submitted VAT Return Forms.</seg>
<seg id="269">The system is also used to verify the validity of Tax IDs of registered VAT payers, eligibility and legality of VAT exemption claims with respect to goods delivered to another EU member country, and to make sure that the goods have been subject to proper taxation.</seg>
<seg id="270">The parallel audits have demonstrated the potential of cooperation between the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices.</seg>
<seg id="271">Results of the audits will be compared against outputs of planned audits, which will focus, inter alia, on verifying the performance of the VIES system insofar as cases of tax evasion arising in connection with so-called „intra-Community deliveries".</seg>
<seg id="272">In the light of the importance of VAT and ExT as budget revenues, audits must be primarily targeted to the monitoring and identification of risky areas, their ultimate objective being to minimize the room and potential of indirect tax dodging.</seg>
<seg id="273">Communique</seg>
<seg id="274">The present report has been executed in Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office and the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says</seg>
<seg id="2">Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.</seg>
<seg id="5">"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."</seg>
<seg id="6">Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."</seg>
<seg id="10">A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thirty-two percent supported such a run.</seg>
<seg id="13">The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm.</seg>
<seg id="2">We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who've been hurt.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk, technology and innovation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Too often now, a single court decision becomes the precedent for other, less compelling cases.</seg>
<seg id="5">From the 1940s until 1971, some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness.</seg>
<seg id="6">The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies, often under generic labels.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the 1970s, scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn't recall whose brand they used.</seg>
<seg id="9">Beginning in 1980, courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable.</seg>
<seg id="10">Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has some logic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Drug makers shouldn't be able to duck liability because people couldn't identify precisely which identical drug was used.</seg>
<seg id="13">But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just as all plaintiffs are not alike, it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lilly, where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz's mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages.</seg>
<seg id="17">But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes, by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="19">The big problem, however, is that there's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="20">The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="21">The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs.</seg>
<seg id="22">The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, citing the huge, hidden social costs. "Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering," the unanimous court said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market.</seg>
<seg id="24">This raises the key issue: What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs?</seg>
<seg id="25">We now know that holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won't be available to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="26">As liability expert Peter Huber tells us, after the Hymowitz case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug "it's time to sell that company's stock short." We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way.</seg>
<seg id="27">DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.</seg>
<seg id="29">But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation.</seg>
<seg id="30">Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases.</seg>
<seg id="32">They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody, but know it won't be done by Congress.</seg>

<seg id="1">18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy</seg>
<seg id="2">Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="5">She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was detained in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="9">District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."</seg>
<seg id="12">Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Like so many trends in the entertainment industry, the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest.</seg>
<seg id="2">The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in Hollywood, especially around feminist issues such as abortion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The latter comes from the perception, on the part of many people in network TV, that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism.</seg>
<seg id="4">Put these together, and you get programs about rape.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of "In the Heat of the Night," the NBC series based on a 1967 feature film about a black Philadelphia police detective in a small Southern town.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and his wife, Althea (Anne-Marie Johnson) have settled in Sparta, Miss.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in Georgia, this episode -- in which Althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously, it's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot TV movie.</seg>
<seg id="9">But tonight's offering, "Settle the Score" (9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC), doesn't even try.</seg>
<seg id="10">This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: "Fear of violence and animosity . . . because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people . . . produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers."</seg>
<seg id="12">The writer and executive producer of "Settle the Score," Steve Sohmer, is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation.</seg>
<seg id="13">At one point in the documentary, Mr. Sohmer, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale.</seg>
<seg id="14">He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand." Mr. Sohmer confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America." But is exile in Hollywood enough?</seg>
<seg id="15">Not to judge by "Settle the Score," in which Mr. Sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex.</seg>
<seg id="18">I mean, these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen-ager, someone tied her hands behind her back, thrust her head into a gunny sack, brutally raped and beat her, and then left her to die in a cold-storage room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Her Pa (Howard Duff) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace at the supper table, pauses at the word "sin" and glares at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="20">People like Pa do exist, of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">But in Mr. Sohmer's Ozarks, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg.</seg>
<seg id="22">Every man Kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical, viciously patronizing, revoltingly lecherous, or all three.</seg>
<seg id="23">Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town America, or even Hollywood's nightmare of small-town America, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale," itself soon to be (you guessed it) a Hollywood movie.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are two exceptions: Josh (Jeffrey DeMunn), the local doctor who has always loved Kate; and Lincoln (Richard Masur), Kate's simple-minded but affectionate brother.</seg>
<seg id="25">Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="26">How could he be?</seg>
<seg id="27">He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for Lincoln, if you can't guess why he's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her, then I'm not going to tell you.</seg>
<seg id="29">As for the women, they're pathetic.</seg>
<seg id="30">Kate's Ma (Louise Latham) is a moral coward.</seg>
<seg id="31">Her sister-in-law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named Tucker, whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies Kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the very least, it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of "Settle the Score." In the aforementioned episode of "In the Heat of the Night," we saw Althea being attacked, but we weren't invited to enjoy the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Mr. Sohmer's film, by contrast, we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim, as the camera ogles Kate in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape.</seg>
<seg id="35">At this point, the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy.</seg>
<seg id="36">Take the scene in which Kate stands naked by a lighted window, whispering to her hidden assailant, "Look all you want.</seg>
<seg id="37">Starting tomorrow, I'm stalking you." Or the one in which she and Josh are stranded in the city, and, after insisting on separate motel rooms, she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape -- wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push-up bra.</seg>
<seg id="38">Surely the question is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="39">With friends like Mr. Sohmer, do the feminists of Hollywood need enemies?</seg>

<seg id="1">It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world's environmental problems ("Is Science, or Private Gain, Driving Ozone Policy?" by George Melloan, Business World, Oct. 24).</seg>
<seg id="2">To suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted.</seg>
<seg id="3">Consider the fact that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason environmentalists "don't mind seeing new crises arise" is because there are new crises.</seg>
<seg id="6">Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you are doubtful, consider for a moment that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey, which supply the tristate area with drinking water, are riddled with toxic PCBs.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group's ploy to create a market.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's time business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral, symbiotic player within nature's workings.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mark T. Kuiper</seg>
<seg id="11">Jersey City, N.J.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Melloan's column was right on the money, but I wish it could have gone one step further.</seg>
<seg id="13">As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the Montreal Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="14">An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design.</seg>
<seg id="15">In my research, I have found a paper by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute and several colleagues reporting an 11-year decrease in UV-B radiation at eight U.S. measurement sites.</seg>
<seg id="16">Our concern for the ozone layer, of course, grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation, which could damage flora and fauna.</seg>
<seg id="17">The last of the measurements reported was in 1985, but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend.</seg>
<seg id="18">I understand, but haven't yet verified, that there are studies by Norwegians, Russians and the Max Planck Institute that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">To me, this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort.</seg>
<seg id="20">This, in turn, threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written.</seg>
<seg id="21">My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Friends of the Earth, etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited.</seg>
<seg id="22">When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study, I was urged to get back to the agenda topic, which was, ironically, a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs, the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario.</seg>
<seg id="23">Subsequently, I have learned that a private group, of which Du Pont is a part, is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments.</seg>
<seg id="24">But this is almost an underground activity.</seg>
<seg id="25">To my knowledge, no government entities, including the EPA, are pursuing UV-B measurements.</seg>
<seg id="26">The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion "establishment" meetings, of which I have attended many.</seg>
<seg id="27">It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by CFCs.</seg>
<seg id="28">While recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened, I intend to urge that UV-B be monitored whenever I can.</seg>

<seg id="34">The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although, like all scientific theories, it had its initial opponents, few experts question the connection now.</seg>
<seg id="36">The discovery of the ozone "hole" over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the September issue of Scientific American, Thomas E. Graedel, distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and Paul J. Crutzen, director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany, wrote, "It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons, particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion." Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, unlike Messrs.</seg>
<seg id="39">Graedel and Crutzen, who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry, Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area.</seg>
<seg id="40">He is a mechanical engineer, not an atmospheric chemist.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists "needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts" and that environmental groups need them to stay in business.</seg>
<seg id="42">Solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry, policy makers and the scientific community world-wide.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side, everything loose would end up in California.</seg>
<seg id="2">We've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California's vitality, but maybe the state's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place.</seg>
<seg id="3">What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state's attorney general?</seg>
<seg id="4">If passed by the voters, the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, ban new offshore drilling, ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer, and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty.</seg>
<seg id="5">The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Interestingly, the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one.</seg>
<seg id="7">Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don't meet the initiative's standards.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market.</seg>
<seg id="10">In other words, California is presuming to take control of the nation's farm policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">As usual the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality.</seg>
<seg id="12">Consider the greenhouse-effect provision.</seg>
<seg id="13">The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory, it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="15">But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative, what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="16">The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's running for governor.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6, 1990.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's also the day of the gubernatorial election.</seg>
<seg id="21">The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money.</seg>
<seg id="22">And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits.</seg>
<seg id="23">He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative (on which there are no limits) is gravy.</seg>
<seg id="24">This initiative is being labeled The Big Green, but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback. (The Republican candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, sponsoring his own crime initiative.)</seg>
<seg id="25">While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional, it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this new proposal ever does become law, the green lobby will benefit directly.</seg>
<seg id="28">The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he doesn't like.</seg>
<seg id="29">That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation; taxpayers would bear the cost.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves.</seg>
<seg id="32">George Bush, for example, may decide that he doesn't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California.</seg>
<seg id="33">And some other segments of California's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="34">This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the futureeither as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality, or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a "monster." Needless to say, he was talking about RICO.</seg>
<seg id="2">With its recently revised guidelines for RICO, Justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="3">The text of the "new policy" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby.</seg>
<seg id="4">They strongly suggest that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics.</seg>
<seg id="6">This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others.</seg>
<seg id="8">This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton/Newport-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases.</seg>
<seg id="9">The forfeiture memo cited "considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process." It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are "less intrusive" alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case not to seek forfeitures "disproportionate to the defendant's crime."</seg>
<seg id="10">These changes come a tad late for Princeton/Newport, the first RICOed securities firm.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture.</seg>
<seg id="12">Princeton/Newport investors, including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment, made the rational decision to withdraw their money; for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000.</seg>
<seg id="14">The experience of Princeton/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.</seg>
<seg id="15">Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges "which the company is not in a position to dispute" because of RICO. Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose.</seg>
<seg id="16">So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did wrong.</seg>
<seg id="17">So two cheers for the new rules.</seg>
<seg id="18">Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova, who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals.</seg>
<seg id="19">But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, "RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence." He said ours is supposed to be "a government of laws not of men," and yet RICO defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO." No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.</seg>
<seg id="21">What now for Princeton/Newport officials, Drexel and Mr. Milken?</seg>
<seg id="22">Justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="23">We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name.</seg>

<seg id="1">An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it's going to hold an election.</seg>
<seg id="3">The most likely winner will be the Marxist-dominated SWAPO rebels.</seg>
<seg id="4">The U.S. journalist's "crime" was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election's fairness, Bryan O'Linn, was openly sympathetic to SWAPO. Shortly after that, Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation, issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year, which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to "insult, disparate or belittle" the election commission.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Stanley affair doesn't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government.</seg>
<seg id="7">To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="8">SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the "sole, authentic representative" of Namibia's people in</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba's "Afrika Korps" from Angola and hold "free and fair" elections that would end South Africa's control of Namibia.</seg>
<seg id="10">The elections are set for Nov. 7.</seg>
<seg id="11">In July, Mr. Stanley, editor of American Press International, a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service, visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="12">He interviewed Mr. O'Linn, head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court.</seg>
<seg id="13">After Mr. Stanley's article was published in two Namibian newspapers, Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors, publisher and lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley's detention.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Stanley's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia's elections.</seg>
<seg id="17">Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters.</seg>
<seg id="18">The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results.</seg>
<seg id="19">It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia.</seg>
<seg id="20">State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Foreword</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lima Declaration was adopted in 1977 and emphasises that the supreme audit institutions (SAI) have powers to carry out audits of all public finances.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Declaration requests that SAI shall be empowered to audit the collection of taxes as extensively as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes one of the most significant parts of the public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="6">The VI Congress EUROSAI held in Bonn in 2005 focused on an audit of public revenues by SAI.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the important steps on the way to optimise the audit activity of a SAI is to work out a special strategy for audit of public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="8">This relates above all to taxes as the biggest source of public revenues that is also at a high risk of loss.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the economies of individual countries are more and more interconnected and interdependent SAI can be, in a certain manner, unable to perform audit activities without cooperation with SAI of other countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">As an example we can mention the audit of internationally organised fraud that causes significant revenue losses in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">In fighting against such crime, the cooperation between authorities is a necessity.</seg>
<seg id="12">SAI that carry out audits in this area need to be willing to work closely together.</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea to carry out an audit on value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) and the VIES system came up at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was performed in cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office and the German Supreme Audit Institution, Bundesrechnungshof.</seg>
<seg id="14">During following detailed preparations, both SAI had to familiarise with the law environment and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Based on an information analysis, we had made the selection of audit topics that we put on the audit programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">Achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of VAT is a long-term problem and individual countries (the EC Member States especially) are looking for an answer on how to improve the system, how to simplify VAT collection and make it more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are convinced that the results of our audit may help not only to improve tax administrators´ work, but also serve as a basis for improving an international information exchange system.</seg>
<seg id="18">Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="19">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="20">Audit number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215</seg>
<seg id="21">Subject of audit:</seg>
<seg id="22">(CZ) Administration of value added tax following accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union</seg>
<seg id="23">(D) Review of the administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004</seg>
<seg id="24">Objective of audit:</seg>
<seg id="25">(CZ) The objective of the audit in the Czech Republic was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating value added tax following integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”), connected with free movement of goods and services, and to review the use of the VIES, particularly monitoring the exercise of the right to exempt intraCommunity deliveries from value added tax.</seg>
<seg id="26">(D) The objective of the audit was to review the system of intraCommunity VAT control with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the above mentioned regulations.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result of this, weaknesses should be reported and recommendations be developed to address the problems stated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Value Added Tax Information Exchange System The audits were performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the “SAO”) and by the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “BRH”) in mutual cooperation on the basis of an agreement concluded between the two audit institutions on June 8, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="29">The cooperation primarily concerned the review of selected commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter “CR”) and from the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”), use of information obtained via international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="30">A joint final report on the results of the audits was processed in the sense of European Directive No. 31 for implementing the INTOSAI audit standards.</seg>
<seg id="31">The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.</seg>
<seg id="32">Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="33">Based on an agreement between the two SAI the parallel audit on the administration of VAT in the CR and Germany was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="34">Besides the main point – exchange of information based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – the audit covered other topics as for instance the registration of taxpayers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements that are closely linked with it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Additionally, the legal situation in terms of international bus transportation of passengers and the comparison of certain statistical data were part of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="36">By comparing the systems of administration of VAT in the two countries differences were found in the following areas:</seg>
<seg id="37">1) Registration for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whereas entrepreneurs in Germany are registered regardless of the volume of their turnover, in the CR the prime criterion (except others) for registration is exceeding of the turnover limit set down in the law on VAT.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the CR, taxpayers are assigned one tax identification number only, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="40">For VAT registration purposes in Germany taxpayers are assigned a tax number that serves only for business transactions within the German territory.</seg>
<seg id="41">If German taxpayers intend to do intra-Community transactions, they have to apply for assignment of a special identification number, so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="42">Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC (see 4.1).</seg>
<seg id="43">2) International bus transportation of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the CR, the international bus transportation of passengers is exempt from VAT with the right for VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="45">In Germany, the part of transportation that takes place in the German territory is subject to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="46">At EC level, efforts should be undertaken to harmonise the situation, in the sense of article 393 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="47">3) VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="48">While in the CR taxpayers submit VAT returns only for particular taxable periods (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of a calendar year, they have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="49">In contrast to Czech taxpayers, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="50">Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the CR would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="51">4) Recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="52">Whereas taxpayers in the CR submit recapitulative statements to tax offices, in Germany taxpayers submit recapitulative statements to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="53">Therefore, tax offices in the CR have the data contained in recapitulative statements available immediately after their submission.</seg>
<seg id="54">German tax offices have information from recapitulative statements available only after their processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="55">Combating VAT fraud requires updated information about intra-Community transactions as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the update of VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="57">Consequently, this would allow timely review of the taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="58">For this purpose all Member States of the EC would have to introduce the same deadline for submission of recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="59">5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="60">On receiving a request for information, the Czech CLO observes compliance with the three-month deadline.</seg>
<seg id="61">The German CLO does not follow up elapsed time.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a result of this the German tax administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of received requests within the set deadline.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because of these problems the BRH recommended to the German CLO to introduce a steady reminding exercise (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="64">6) Risk management.</seg>
<seg id="65">Each of both Member States is developing its own risk management system (hereinafter “RMS”), that has its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="66">The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.</seg>
<seg id="67">Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).</seg>
<seg id="68">As part of cooperation, the two SAI reviewed selected cases of intra-Community transactions processed by tax entities in the CR and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="69">Thirty-one cases of business transactions were reviewed jointly using the legal provisions of the CLO, where there were doubts about their realization, their proper treatment or suspicion of VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="70">The SAI found that:</seg>
<seg id="71">In some cases, tax offices made use of the information obtained via international exchange and have reassessed taxpayer’s VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="72">In those cases, taxpayers either unlawfully applied the right for exemption of supplies from VAT, or did not declare acquisition of goods in their VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="73">In some cases, tax offices could not make use of the information obtained, because the information was incomplete or incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="74">In other cases, the information could not be used because of differing legal provisions in both Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to reply to a request for information.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some cases were detected, where taxpayers wrongly declared business transactions in their recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="77">As a result of this, data in VIES were erroneous and therefore the tax administrators had to review those cases (see 6).</seg>
<seg id="78">Audit procedure</seg>
<seg id="79">Audit procedure in the CR</seg>
<seg id="80">The audit was performed in the period from June 2006 to March 2007 by the Division II – Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.</seg>
<seg id="81">The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter the “MoF”) and 10 tax offices – the tax office in Humpolec, the tax office in Jihlava, the tax office in Kadaň, the tax office in Liberec, the tax office in Nymburk, the tax office in Otrokovice, the tax office for Prague 1, the tax office for Prague 4, the tax office in Sokolov and the tax office in Třinec.</seg>
<seg id="82">The SAO Collegium approved the conclusions of this audit on April 23, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="83">Audit procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="84">The audit was performed in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="85">It was part of the audit programme for 2006 and therefore announced to the Federal MoF in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="86">After a test phase the audit started in the fourth quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="87">According to the cases selected by the BRH and later selected by the SAO, the BRH notified a number of federal states of the audit mission.</seg>
<seg id="88">Besides interviews at the Federal MoF and the CLO the audit was conducted in the following federal states:</seg>
<seg id="89">Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tax files of the following tax offices were included:</seg>
<seg id="91">Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV und München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord und Hamburg für Großunternehmen, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I und Zschopau.</seg>
<seg id="92">Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim und Verden.</seg>
<seg id="93">The audit findings were reported to the MoF in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cooperation of the two audit institutions</seg>
<seg id="95">As part of preparing parallel audits, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions were held in the period prior to their commencement.</seg>
<seg id="96">Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of the tax administrations, legislation on VAT and the VAT administration system in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="97">The subject matter of the testing phase was agreed at the meeting that was held in May 2006.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results of the testing phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="99">At this meeting, also a timetable was agreed for further procedure, and the following subjects for parallel audits were selected:</seg>
<seg id="100">1. Registration of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="101">2.</seg>
<seg id="102">International passenger bus transportation – legislation in the CR and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="103">3. International exchange of information, in particular the processing of requests for information and furthermore how the tax offices reviewed selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, and in the spontaneous information supplied between the CR and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="104">4. VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="105">5.</seg>
<seg id="106">Recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="107">6.</seg>
<seg id="108">Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and the Germany.</seg>
<seg id="109">7. VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="110">At a meeting of the SAO and the BRH, held in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with the audit procedure in the CR and Germany and discussed results achieved in the parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="111">A report on the results of the parallel audits of the administration of VAT between the CR and Germany was elaborated at the working meeting in July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="112">4. Administration of value added tax in the CR and Germany</seg>
<seg id="113">Registrace plátců k DPH</seg>
<seg id="114">A) Taxpayers with their offi cial seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR</seg>
<seg id="115">Pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees (hereinafter “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”) the term tax entity refers to a taxpayer, a taxable person and the legal successor of a natural or legal person that is a tax entity definedby law.</seg>
<seg id="116">As of December 31, 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="117">The number of tax entities registered for VAT has increased to 457,590 by 1 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="118">A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, whose turnover in the most recent 12 preceding consecutive calendar months exceeded the sum of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) becomes a taxpayer on the 1st day of the third month following after the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).</seg>
<seg id="119">This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.</seg>
<seg id="120">The current legislation does not permit registering a person obliged to pay tax retroactively in cases taxpayers exceed the legal term to submit the application for registration.</seg>
<seg id="121">A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who performs taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to tax deduction, is obliged to register for VAT even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), provided that he fulfils any of other conditions stated in the Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="122">A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who does not fulfil any of the conditions stated by the law, may apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="123">When the application for registration is submitted to the competent local tax administrator the registration procedure pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll. starts.</seg>
<seg id="124">A voluntary VAT payer shall also state, in the application for registration for VAT, the date as of which he requests registration as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="125">The tax administrator shall verify the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all its annexes.</seg>
<seg id="126">If he is in doubt as to the stated data, he shall request the tax entity to explain, supplement or document the data.</seg>
<seg id="127">When the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, he shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and that it has been allocated a tax identification number (hereinafter the “ID”).</seg>
<seg id="128">In the certificate the tax administrator shall state the date when the registration for VAT became effective and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="129">The taxable period is one calendar quarter unless the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).</seg>
<seg id="130">If the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the taxable period is one calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="131">A taxpayer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year attained an amount of CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month as the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.</seg>
<seg id="132">The assignment of an ID in the certificate of registration is always constitutive in character.</seg>
<seg id="133">The tax entity is obliged to state it in all communications (including payments) with the tax administrator, and in those cases stipulated by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in drawing up tax documents).</seg>
<seg id="134">The ID contains the code “CZ” and a basic part, consisting of a general identifier.</seg>
<seg id="135">For natural persons, the general identifier is the birth certificate number or some other general identifier if so stipulated by a special law, and for a legal person, the general identifier is the business identification number (provisions of § 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="136">If the tax entity has not fulfilled its obligation in spite of being requested to do so by the tax administrator, the competent local tax administrator shall register it at his own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="137">The registration proceeding results in the issuing a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which shall be delivered to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the CR, a tax entity that has acquired authorisation for a business activity is assigned an ID at the moment of his first registration for any kind of tax.</seg>
<seg id="139">The tax entity also uses the same ID when he is registered as a VAT payer.</seg>
<seg id="140">According to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which came into effect on January 1, 2005, in case of failure to comply with the registration obligation for VAT, the tax administrator may require that the taxable person has to pay up to 10% of the total revenues or income for taxable transactions that this person performed illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been registered as a taxpayer by law to the date on which he became a taxpayer on the basis of a decision by the tax administrator (provision of § 98 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="141">Payment of this stipulated amount is considered to constitute payment of tax of § 98 (3) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="142">When the conditions laid down by law are met, the registration of a VAT payer may be cancelled for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="143">1)</seg>
<seg id="144">Cancellation of the registration at the taxpayer’s request, i.e. primarily for reasons of the level of turnover, which does not attain the registration limit (§ 106 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="145">Taxpayers may request cancellation of registration not earlier than 1 year after the date of legal force mentioned in the certificate of registration.</seg>
<seg id="146">2) Cancellation of registration “ex officio” (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), “if: a) the taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) the taxpayer failed to fulfill his obligations pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes”.</seg>
<seg id="147">B) Taxpayers without an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR A person registered for taxes in another Member State, who does not have an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, or a foreign person obliged to pay tax, who performs a transaction which takes place in this country and who is a person obliged to report and pay taxes on such supply pursuant to § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (i.e. an “non-resident taxpayer”) becomes a taxpayer on the date of performing this transaction.</seg>
<seg id="148">This person is obliged to submit an application for registration with the tax office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of performance of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="149">In the application for registration, he is obliged to report all VAT IDs that he was assigned to in other Member States or in a third country.</seg>
<seg id="150">If a “non-resident” taxpayer submits an application for registration later than on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR, the tax office for Prague 1 shall register him retroactively as, pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="151">In cases of retroactive registration, the tax office for Prague 1 shall request from tax entities a document that the supply was performed (invoices or explanatory letters).</seg>
<seg id="152">If a “non-resident” tax entity requests registration in the CR, prior to performance of the first taxable transaction the tax office for Prague 1 shall request submission of agreements that the performance of the transaction will occur.</seg>
<seg id="153">As of December 31, 2004, a total of 473 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered at the tax office for Prague 1, of which 124 were taxpayers from Germany; as of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered, of which 233 were taxpayers from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="154">Pursuant to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., tax administrators shall be authorised to cancel the registration of an “non-resident” taxpayer as of January 31 of the following calendar year if this taxpayer does not incur any obligation to report and pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="155">The SAO found that, if a “non-resident” taxpayer submitted a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal requirements of the date for submitting a tax return, the tax office often has not yet received it by 31 January.</seg>
<seg id="156">In cases where these facts, decisive for the possibility of cancelling registration, are known by the tax office later than 31 January, it is not possible to cancel the registration for VAT for the “non-resident” taxpayer in the CR in the given calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="157">Registration of taxpayers in Germany</seg>
<seg id="158">Due to the legal provisions in the German fiscal code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter “AO”) anybody who performs a business is obliged to inform the municipality and/or the tax office in charge.</seg>
<seg id="159">The deadline for submitting the information is one month after the start of the business.</seg>
<seg id="160">The municipality conveys the information to the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="161">If the tax authority finds out a going but unregistered business the competent tax office is able to register the taxpayer ex officio – even retroactively.</seg>
<seg id="162">Taxpayers in Germany, both being resident or non-resident, are legally obliged to register for VAT whenever they fulfil the criteria set forth in § 2 of the German VAT law (hereinafter “UStG).</seg>
<seg id="163">This does not depend on the volume of turnover produced.</seg>
<seg id="164">A voluntary registration does not exist in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="165">For entrepreneurs who are resident abroad special tax offices exist.</seg>
<seg id="166">For instance for those who have their seat in the CR the tax office Chemnitz-Süd is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="167">As of 30 April 2004 a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered by the tax office Chemnitz-Süd; as of 1 March 2006 a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.</seg>
<seg id="168">The BRH found that those special tax offices frequently denied the registration of so called quasi-dependent freelancers with a residence in the new eastern Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="169">Since after joining the EC the labour permits for employees of the ten new European Member States are limited, those freelancers tried to avoid these limits by starting a business.</seg>
<seg id="170">These businesses do not fulfil the criteria for entrepreneurs as set in § 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a sole employer who determines their labour time and the way of doing their labour.</seg>
<seg id="171">In order to get registered the entrepreneur has to complete a questionnaire of the competent tax office, in which he has to give information about the company and the activities performed.</seg>
<seg id="172">The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="173">It is processed either in special units of the tax office or in the general units that are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="174">With the help of this form a risk assessment of the individual taxpayer is carried out before the tax office issues a tax number.</seg>
<seg id="175">The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows specific rules:</seg>
<seg id="176">First three figures provide the information which tax office is in charge of, the subsequent three (or four) give information about which department in the tax office is responsible, the next five (or four) are for classifying taxpayers whereas the last one is always a check digit.</seg>
<seg id="177">If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to receive tax-exempt intraCommunity supplies.</seg>
<seg id="178">A VAT ID is granted by the CLO upon application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="179">The VAT ID will be assigned automatically by the CLO when taxpayers declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="180">The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a string of nine numbers.</seg>
<seg id="181">An entrepreneur can be deregistered: 1. On application (for instance when he gave up his business) after all the administrative work is done (assessments for all business years) and 2. in case the tax administration realises that he no longer carries out a business.</seg>
<seg id="182">Usually the validity of the VAT ID is aligned with the validity of the VAT number.</seg>
<seg id="183">The tax offices have to inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number so that the CLO can end the validity of the VAT ID in those cases.</seg>
<seg id="184">According to German VAT law (§ 19 (1) UStG) resident taxpayers are not obliged to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus respective VAT of the previous calendar year did not exceed the amount of EUR 17,500 and 2. is not likely to exceed the amount of EUR 50,000 in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="185">The so-called „Kleinunternehmer“ (small entrepreneurs) are not allowed to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="186">Though they are not obliged to pay VAT small entrepreneurs have to be registered by the tax office and have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="187">A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.</seg>
<seg id="188">This declaration is binding for the following five years.</seg>
<seg id="189">He is then allowed to invoice VAT and to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="190">Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).</seg>
<seg id="191">The precondition for this is that they are involved in tax exempt transactions only and are not entitled to deduct input tax.</seg>
<seg id="192">The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur so that he does not need to register for VAT.</seg>
<seg id="193">The invoices have to mention that fiscal representation is applied.</seg>
<seg id="194">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="195">The situation is different in both countries.</seg>
<seg id="196">Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independent of their turnover volume, in the CR, the first criteria (besides other) for registration is the excess of the limit set forth in the VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="197">If a tax entity does not exceed the set limit, it has an option to ask for voluntary registration.</seg>
<seg id="198">The registration process is standardised in Germany but differences may occur because of varying organisational patterns in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="199">In the CR, a taxpayer is assigned a tax identification number at the time of his first registration for any tax.</seg>
<seg id="200">In case taxpayers register for VAT, they use the same ID also in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="201">In Germany, a taxpayer registering for VAT is assigned a tax number serving only for transactions within the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="202">If the German taxpayer intends to do intra-Community transactions, he has to ask for assignment of a special identification number, a so-called VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="203">Both the SAO and the BRH found the German two-stage system of registration could cause a lot of misunderstandings in other Member States such as the CR that allocates one single identification number for both national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="204">On the other hand, the two-stage system permits the retroactive (national) registration in cases where taxpayers refuse to inform the municipality or the competent tax office about his business.</seg>
<seg id="205">This retroactive registration ensures the proper VAT assessment of previous assessment periods, especially an exact estimation of a VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="206">Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC.</seg>
<seg id="207">German Parliament recently decided to establish a tax identification number (hereinafter TIN).</seg>
<seg id="208">The Federal Finance Office will allocate the TIN after the birth of a natural person.</seg>
<seg id="209">This TIN will be valid for the whole life of a natural person resident in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="210">If a natural person starts a business the competent tax office will apply for an economic TIN that will be used as a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="211">So in future there should be no time lag between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="212">The work to implement an IT medium to administrate the TINs has not been finished until now.</seg>
<seg id="213">International passenger bus transportation</seg>
<seg id="214">Legislation in the CR</seg>
<seg id="215">Pursuant to the provisions of § 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the transportation of passengers between the individual Member States and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT in the CR, with the right for tax deduction, as from May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="216">This transportation is exempt from VAT even if performed by entrepreneurs who are registered for taxes in other Member States or a foreign person obliged to pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="217">In this respect, return transport is considered to be a separate transport.</seg>
<seg id="218">If “non-resident” tax entities do not perform any other economic activity in the CR except for international passenger bus transport, they are not obliged to register in the CR as VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="219">International passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the CR on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR, Annex No. V, Chap. 5 (1) (b), where it is stated that:</seg>
<seg id="220">“For the purposes of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain an exemption from value added tax on international transport of passengers, referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, until the condition set out in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or for as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States, whichever is the earlier.”</seg>
<seg id="221">Legislation in Germany</seg>
<seg id="222">According to Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 as implemented into § 3b (1) UStG the place of the supply of transport of passengers is the place where the route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="223">So the German taxation does not make a distinction between a national and an international cross-border transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="224">Only the part of the transport occurring on German territory, is a taxable supply of transport in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="225">Also the German taxation does not distinguish between resident and non-resident taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="226">If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany the part of the route in Germany is also considered as a taxable supply of transport.</seg>
<seg id="227">The non-resident taxpayer has to announce his intention to supply the transport of passengers to the tax office in charge before he accomplishes his services in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="228">The tax office registers the non-resident taxpayer for taxation (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is named in the taxpayer’s announcement.</seg>
<seg id="229">The taxpayer has to declare his taxable supplies of transport in a German VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="230">As of 1 March 2006, the tax office Chemnitz-Süd registered 741 Czech taxpayers whose business was the transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="231">If the transport of passengers is supplied to a resident taxable person for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the tax office by himself.</seg>
<seg id="232">Instead of him the resident acquirer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer; this process is known as reverse charge and consistent with Article 196 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="233">Apart from the announcement of a non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return the German tax administration has several means to assess the accurate declaration of taxable supplies of transport of passengers:</seg>
<seg id="234">Mobile control groups of the customs authority audit the certificates of foreign-licensed busses that are used to transport passengers through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="235">After each audit the mobile control groups send an inspection note to the tax office in charge.</seg>
<seg id="236">If the bus driver lacks a valid certificate the mobile control group is authorised to demand the VAT from the bus driver before he continues the transport.</seg>
<seg id="237">The non-resident taxpayer can deduct this paid VAT from the tax calculated in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="238">If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return it can announce an audit that has to take place in the tax office or it can use the means of administrative cooperation that are named in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="239">Even if the non-resident taxpayer declines the payment of the lawfully stated VAT, the tax office can ask for the administrative cooperation of Council Directive 76/308/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="240">To review a non-resident taxpayer’s VAT return or the fulfilment of his obligations, the BRH considered all these means of administrative cooperation as too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT that have to be paid for taxable supplies of transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="241">Especially an audit of a non-resident taxpayer’s accounting leads to disproportional costs for both taxpayers and tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="242">The latter has to audit the foreign accounting that does not only mean to understand the foreign language but to also know the foreign accounting standards.</seg>
<seg id="243">So this audit is likely to take more time than an audit of a resident taxpayer, yet the audit is restricted to those passenger transports, that take place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="244">On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer has not only to accept the audit rights of his national tax administration but also audits of other Member States wherever he transports passengers.</seg>
<seg id="245">Moreover, for each Member State in that only one supply of transport of passengers takes place, taxpayers have to fulfil any duties of taxation in all of these Member States, respectively in all different languages and using all tax forms of these EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="246">So the actual taxation of crossborder transport of passengers causes unreasonable bureaucratic costs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="248">The legal situation in both countries is different.</seg>
<seg id="249">In the CR, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States of the EC and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with the right for tax deduction, on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR.</seg>
<seg id="250">In Germany, the part of the transport, that takes place within the German territory, is a taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="251">If a non-resident taxpayer provides such transport for the first time, he is obliged to announce it to a competent tax office in advance.</seg>
<seg id="252">The tax office registers taxpayers and taxpayers have to declare the taxable portion of transport in a tax return in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="253">Applying the law in Germany is very time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="254">At least three of four Czech taxpayers registered in the tax office Chemnitz-Süd do their business in the transport of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="255">Compared to the efforts required tax revenue is rather low.</seg>
<seg id="256">The Member States – that levy VAT in accordance to Article 46 of the Council directive 2006/112/EC of November 28th, 2006, on the common system of VAT – are burdened with time-consuming duties without a financially sensible goal.</seg>
<seg id="257">To avoid the disproportional costs to assess the VAT, the supplies of cross-border transport of passengers should be taxed in one Member State only.</seg>
<seg id="258">This could be the state where the transport begins or where the supplier is resident.</seg>
<seg id="259">Such taxation would require a modification of the Council directive 2006/112/EC.</seg>
<seg id="260">VAT returns</seg>
<seg id="261">Submitting and processing of VAT returns in the CR</seg>
<seg id="262">A taxpayer is obliged to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the MoF within 25 days after the end of the taxable period, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless the law stipulates otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="263">The actual tax liability falls due within the deadline for submitting the VAT return, with the exception of tax assessed in connection with import of goods pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., where the due date for the taxes is stipulated by the customs regulations.</seg>
<seg id="264">If a returnable overpayment occurs as a consequence of excessive deduction, it is returned to the taxpayer without request within 30 days after assessing the excessive deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">The deadline is not applied in cases, where the tax administrator commences tax proceedings concerning taxpayer’s tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="266">In accordance with § 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct input tax may be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to tax deduction could be exercised.</seg>
<seg id="267">After expiry of this deadline, the right to deduct input tax may further be exercised within 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.</seg>
<seg id="268">However, this is possible only through submission of an additional VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="269">An amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from January 1, 2005, permits submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.</seg>
<seg id="270">A taxpayer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, b) he performs corrections in which the last known tax liability does not change, but only information formerly stated by the tax entity is changed, c) he corrects the rate and amount of taxes pursuant to § 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="271">A taxpayer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces his tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="272">The taxpayer is obliged to submit the additional VAT return by the end of the following month after determination of these facts.</seg>
<seg id="273">A VAT return may be submitted in electronic form either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.</seg>
<seg id="274">Submission by Internet may be performed as a submission with a data report attached with a certified electronic signature or as a submission without attaching a data report with a certified electronic signature.</seg>
<seg id="275">If a data report is not attached with a certified electronic signature, it must also be submitted in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer file to the tax administrator (e-form).</seg>
<seg id="276">The VAT return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="277">Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="278">Some lines are used for the purpose of primary automated controls as part of the ATIS system.</seg>
<seg id="279">The value of goods supplied to other EC Member States for entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared to the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="280">The value of goods acquired from other Member States from entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared with the values obtained via the VIES system from recapitulative statements of taxpayers from other Member States of the EC.</seg>
<seg id="281">Under the ATIS system, a test of the trustworthiness of VAT returns takes place at the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="282">This test occurs automatically as the VAT return cannot be assessed without performance of the test.</seg>
<seg id="283">The test of the trustworthiness includes a calculation of the trustworthiness criteria and an evaluation of the risky types of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="284">Pursuant to the Provisions of § 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who does not meet his obligations of a non-monetary nature following from this or a special tax law or imposed in a decision pursuant to this law.</seg>
<seg id="285">Automated tax information system, which the tax office uses for technical support for administration of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="286">The SAO found that the tax offices mostly did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers for failure to submit a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="287">Submitting and processing of VAT returns in Germany</seg>
<seg id="288">In Germany we differentiate between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="289">Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns nevertheless have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="290">Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT have to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="291">Taxpayers generally have to submit quarterly VAT returns by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="292">However, if the VAT liability exceeded EUR 6,136 in the previous calendar year or in case of a newly established business the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT returns by the 10th day following the respective month.</seg>
<seg id="293">The taxpayer may also choose to submit monthly VAT returns if there was a refund in the preceding year, which exceeded EUR 6,136 (§ 18 (2a) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="294">VAT returns need not be submitted if the annual VAT did not exceed EUR 512.</seg>
<seg id="295">The corresponding VAT liability has to be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT arose.</seg>
<seg id="296">A refund may lead to a more detailed investigation by the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="297">Deadlines (by law) for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of excessive VAT do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="298">To achieve the refund in time, it is possible to offer a security for the repayable amount.</seg>
<seg id="299">It is a basic principle to process VAT returns and refunds promptly.</seg>
<seg id="300">Under German VAT law this time limit may be extended (§ 18 (6) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="301">Such extension has to be applied for separately.</seg>
<seg id="302">Taxpayers may submit VAT returns and pay the corresponding VAT liabilities one month later, provided that in case of monthly returns a special advance payment is made.</seg>
<seg id="303">This payment is balanced against the December VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="304">Whenever a mistake is detected a corrected VAT return has to be submitted by the entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="305">An “additional” VAT return does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="306">Once the annual VAT return which has to be submitted until 31 May of the following calendar year is filed with the tax office the entrepreneur cannot correct a wrong preliminary VAT return but his wrong annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="307">A correction of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer is possible during the following four years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="308">As a rule, after these four years an annual VAT return may be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="309">Taxpayers are obliged to submit the preliminary VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="310">The tax offices to avoid undue hardships can apply exceptions to this rule.</seg>
<seg id="311">Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via Internet with or without certification.</seg>
<seg id="312">If done without certification taxpayers have to submit the return once more on paper with their personal signature.</seg>
<seg id="313">In cases of non-submission of VAT returns the tax administration is authorised to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer’s turnover.</seg>
<seg id="314">In cases of delayed submission an additional penalty charge can be levied on the taxpayer (the maximum is 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000).</seg>
<seg id="315">During a previous audit the BRH found that the tax offices frequently do not impose this default fine.</seg>
<seg id="316">In the other cases the tax offices imposed the penalty the amount was assessed inconsistently and highhandedly.</seg>
<seg id="317">So the default fine misses its goal to shorten the average delay particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="318">The tax return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.</seg>
<seg id="319">Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="320">Non-taxable transactions have to be declared in a separate line of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="321">VAT returns that are submitted on paper have to be recorded either via scanner or by special staff.</seg>
<seg id="322">The data of electronically submitted VAT returns are available to the tax administrator immediately.</seg>
<seg id="323">THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank</seg>
<seg id="324">After all data are logged in the system the risk management is applied to it and all cases meeting certain criteria are selected.</seg>
<seg id="325">Those VAT returns chosen have to be checked by the tax administrator based on the inspection note produced by the system (see 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="326">Although the tax administration has to estimate roughly the VAT the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="327">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="328">In the CR, taxpayers submit VAT returns until 25 days after the end of a taxable period.</seg>
<seg id="329">Depending on taxpayer’s turnover, taxable period is either the calendar quarter orcalendar month.</seg>
<seg id="330">In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year either until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.</seg>
<seg id="331">By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are obliged to submit an annual VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="332">The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some pros and cons:</seg>
<seg id="333">+ after the expiration of the calendar year taxpayers are able to correct the errors in the monthly preliminary VAT returns by submission of one single VAT return;</seg>
<seg id="334">– if taxpayers correct their statements concerning intraCommunity transactions the correction cannot be related to a reporting period of the recapitulative statement;</seg>
<seg id="335">– the federal states compare the data of VIES about intraCommunity acquisitions of German taxpayers not until the annual VAT returns are usually processed.</seg>
<seg id="336">In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs are obliged to submit an annual VAT return independently from the amount of their turnover.</seg>
<seg id="337">This duty enables the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="338">Furthermore the tax office in charge is able to compare the annual VAT return with those for direct taxes and with the year-end accounts.</seg>
<seg id="339">In the CR, tax administrators are able to determine the volume of taxpayer’s turnover only from submitted income tax return.</seg>
<seg id="340">In contrast to the CR, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns electronically.</seg>
<seg id="341">Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns in the CR electronically would increase the efficiency of Czech tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="342">Recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="343">Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR</seg>
<seg id="344">Pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., recapitulative statements (hereinafter “RS”) are submitted by a taxpayer who supplied goods to another Member State to a person registered for taxes in the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="345">Information on the value of goods supplied is always stated in the RS in Czech currency and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.</seg>
<seg id="346">Data on services are not provided in the RS.</seg>
<seg id="347">Taxpayers submit an RS for monthly and quarterly taxable periods for each calendar quarter to the 25th day after its termination to the competent local tax office.</seg>
<seg id="348">Erroneous data are corrected in the corrected RS within 15 days after identifying the errors.</seg>
<seg id="349">Erroneous data stated in the RS are always replaced by the data stated in the corrected RS.</seg>
<seg id="350">Similar to tax returns, taxpayers may also submit RS in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="351">If a taxpayer does not submit a RS or corrected RS and was obliged to do so pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator shall invite him to submit them and shall simultaneously advise him about the consequences of not submitting the RS or corrected RS, i.e. that in case of a failure to comply with obligations of a non-monetary nature, the tax administrator is authorised to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) pursuant to § 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.</seg>
<seg id="352">The SAO found that the tax offices frequently did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers failing to comply with their legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="353">Particularly in relation to submitting RS, tax entities are not adequately motivated to comply with their obligations as a failure to submit RS does not affect their VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="354">Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to verify data in the RS or corrected RS, to eliminate any lack of clarity and use the data for determining tax liability.</seg>
<seg id="355">Where the data in the RS and the data in the relevant VAT returns (taxpayers with monthly taxable period) or relevant VAT return (taxpayers with quarterly taxable period) do not correspond, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of tax liability stated in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="356">The tax entity eliminates erroneous information in the RS through submission of a corrected RS at its own initiative or it may be invited to do so.</seg>
<seg id="357">The tax administrator shall correct data on supply of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:</seg>
<seg id="358">– if taxpayers can not justify the data stated in the RS (or corrected RS) and therefore correct them by submission of a corrected RS,</seg>
<seg id="359">– the tax administrator demonstrated that the data stated by taxpayers in the RS or corrected RS are not accurate.</seg>
<seg id="360">Corrections entered by the tax administrator without the submission of a corrected RS by these taxpayers shall not replace a submission by the tax entity, but only adjust the data in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and precise.</seg>
<seg id="361">Data from the RS are sent to the relevant Member States.</seg>
<seg id="362">Solely the national financial administrative authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may send and receive this data. This is the CLO (in CR this function is fulfilled by the MoF, International Cooperation in VAT Administration Department (CLO)).</seg>
<seg id="363">O_MCTL is an automatic report that the CLO obtains from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="364">It contains all the erroneous VAT IDs entered in the sent RS lines.</seg>
<seg id="365">If the erroneous VAT ID is used on some of the transferred common lines of the RS or corrected RS, an entry is made in the table of the erroneous VAT IDs.</seg>
<seg id="366">The table contains a “Notification of doubts on VAT ID”.</seg>
<seg id="367">The tax administrator verifies the data and records the result of verification in the system.</seg>
<seg id="368">Concerning acquisition of goods from another Member State, taxpayers are obliged to declare VAT and state the acquisition value in separate lines of the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="369">Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of the acquired goods declared by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns and the value of the supplied goods as entered by taxpayers from another Member State in their RS, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for review.</seg>
<seg id="370">The tax administrators are obliged to investigate discrepancies.</seg>
<seg id="371">Three situations can occur:</seg>
<seg id="372">a) The value declared by a Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is lower than the value of the supply declared by taxpayers from the EC.</seg>
<seg id="373">In this case, the tax administrator verifies the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="374">b) The amount of the difference equals 0.</seg>
<seg id="375">This situation can occur either through a change in data in the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his RS) or through a change in data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity submits an additional VAT return by itself in the meantime).</seg>
<seg id="376">In this case, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he nonetheless verifies the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="377">c) The value of goods acquired from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer entered in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the supplied goods declared by EC taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="378">Here again, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he verifies the accuracy of the data.</seg>
<seg id="379">After the verifying the difference and clarifying the underlying reasons the tax administrator enters the results of the verification into ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="380">The results of verification are transferred to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="381">The number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for review for the individual quarters of 2005 is illustrated in graph No. 1 (Note: source: MoF).</seg>
<seg id="382">Graph No. 1 above documents that the number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for the individual quarters of 2005 decreased.</seg>
<seg id="383">There was a substantial decrease in the number of the 4th quarter of 2005, because the CLO increased the minimal financial limit, i.a., with respect to the possibility of sending a request for information to the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="384">Discrepancies between data in the VAT returns and data from the EC need not always to be caused by an error on the part of the domestic taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="385">It may also be attributable to an error on the part of the EC taxpayer or an error that occurred because some types of supplies may be entered in the RS differently in the individual EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="386">The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions revealed at the audited tax offices are given in Table No. 1.</seg>
<seg id="387">Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany</seg>
<seg id="388">Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions are required to file quarterly RS in that the intra-Community deliveries per recipient are listed (§ 18a (1) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="389">The RS must be filed until the 10th day of the month following the respective calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="390">If extension is granted for the preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the RS.</seg>
<seg id="391">The RS needs to be delivered to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="392">Starting from 1 January 2007 they have to be delivered electronically.</seg>
<seg id="393">The competent tax offices may grant exceptions to certain taxpayers to avoid undue hardships.</seg>
<seg id="394">In cases where taxpayers realise that the RS was wrong they are obliged to submit a corrected statement within one month.</seg>
<seg id="395">If taxpayers failed to submit an RS the CLO will initiate a procedure to ensure submission of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="396">This procedure includes: – first reminder – second reminder linked with the threat of a fine and – imposing the fine.</seg>
<seg id="397">Although the German Fiscal Code permits imposing a fine up to EUR 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.</seg>
<seg id="398">Besides this, § 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that taxpayers act illegally if they intentionally or carelessly do not issue a RS properly, state it incompletely or not in time or if they do not amend a RS at all or not in time.</seg>
<seg id="399">This offence can be sanctioned by a fine up to EUR 5,000.</seg>
<seg id="400">Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office because processing of RS is an exclusive task of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="401">RS data are stored in the system of the CLO only.</seg>
<seg id="402">So the figures of the RS are visible to the tax office only after their processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="403">The deadlines for processing RS are set forth in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="404">Data of the RS have to be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="405">In case of erroneous VAT IDs in the RS of German taxpayers the CLO gets an O_MCTL from the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="406">The CLO contacts the entrepreneur and asks for the accurate data.</seg>
<seg id="407">If the CLO does not succeed in getting the correct information the case is handed over to the competent tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="408">It is now their turn to ask for the correct data.</seg>
<seg id="409">The BRH found out that most of the entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID on request of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="410">However, the reminder, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take too much time in cases where a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="411">Those cases that were finally reported to the competent tax offices, were usually completed within one or two months.</seg>
<seg id="412">The tax office refused the tax exemption of the declared intra-Community supplies in 73 % of these cases.</seg>
<seg id="413">If taxpayers submitted the right VAT ID the tax office asked them to submit a corrected RS to the CLO, because the tax offices are not able to correct the VIES data by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="414">The BRH found that neither the tax offices nor the CLO monitored the submission of the corrected RS. So often taxpayers did not comply with the request.</seg>
<seg id="415">Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data a comparison of the data on supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the RS does not take place before submitting those data to the CLO of the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="416">This check is possible only for the tax offices and is usually made when preparing a VAT audit.</seg>
<seg id="417">Data received from other Member States are processed in the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="418">Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and submitted to the respective Member States.</seg>
<seg id="419">The data are used for purposes of acquisition control in the tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="420">As soon as they are in the system the CLO checks them against the data of previous calendar quarters.</seg>
<seg id="421">In cases that comply with certain criteria (see 5.2) control information is created and sent to the competent tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="422">This is done permanently whereas a compilation of the acquisition data for all taxpayers is created later and submitted to the tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="423">The RMS installed for the assessment procedure then checks those data against the data of intraCommunity acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="424">This system completely covers those entrepreneurs, who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.</seg>
<seg id="425">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="426">In the CR, taxpayers that delivered intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, submit a RS within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to a competent local tax office.</seg>
<seg id="427">Tax offices process RS and transmit the data to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="428">Values of intra-Community supplies, stated by taxpayers in the RS, are compared by the tax offices with the values of intraCommunity supplies, stated by the same taxpayers in VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="429">Results of the comparison are used as part of assessment proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="430">In Germany, taxpayers that performed intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit quarterly RS within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Taxpayers submit the RS to the CLO, as from 1 January 2007 electronically.</seg>
<seg id="432">For tax offices, the data from RS are at disposal only after their processing at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="433">Taxpayers both from the CR and Germany declare in RS only supplies of goods.</seg>
<seg id="434">Rendering of services is not stated in RS.In contrast to the Czech tax offices the German tax offices are not able to correct wrong lines in a submitted RS by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="435">Owing to this limited access to the German VIES data wrong VAT IDs were not corrected even if taxpayers communicated the right VAT ID to the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="436">The German tax administration does not compare the data of intra-Community supplies that are declared in a German taxpayer’s VAT return with his RS.</seg>
<seg id="437">Differences between the data of these two returns are usually not detected before the German CLO submits the VIES data to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="438">Considering these findings of the BRH it is obvious that a comparison would increase the reliability of the submitted VIES data.</seg>
<seg id="439">Data on supply of goods for the Czech taxpayers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the CR with data on acquisition of goods as stated in the Czech taxpayers´ VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="440">Comparison is made by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.</seg>
<seg id="441">The most important deviations are transmitted to the tax offices for review.</seg>
<seg id="442">Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German one does not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="443">Such a general verification is carried out only for taxpayers, which are not fully entitled to deduct input VAT.</seg>
<seg id="444">Furthermore, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS produces an inspection note or if taxpayers are selected for an audit at any rate.</seg>
<seg id="445">This process disburdens the tax offices to clarify the reasons of any difference.</seg>
<seg id="446">On the other hand the disclosure of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.</seg>
<seg id="447">Combating carousel fraud requires continually updated information about intra-Community acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="448">The current system of RS, especially VIES, provides the tax authorities with information which may even be six months old.</seg>
<seg id="449">This time lag could be shortened by up to four months if taxpayers had to submit a monthly RS.</seg>
<seg id="450">The monthly submission would not be a considerable increase in bureaucratic costs because most of the taxpayers in CR and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns anyway – and the RS do not require any further information than the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="451">To avoid any bureaucratic costs the submission of the RS could be connected with the submission of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="452">However, an obligation to submit monthly RS would cause more temporary mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community supplies and intra-Community acquisitions and it would increase the data ﬂows between CLO.</seg>
<seg id="453">In 2006 the German Federal Government considered the general institution of monthly RS.</seg>
<seg id="454">The implementation failed because of doubts of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="455">They feared that a monthly submission of VIES data to CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="456">In fact – if the obligation of monthly RS and the monthly submission of VIES data should be effective – a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly RS.</seg>
<seg id="457">Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and Germany</seg>
<seg id="458">As regards foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the CR.</seg>
<seg id="459">The total quantities of intra-Community transactions in goods between the CR and Germany are set forth in Table No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="460">The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="461">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="462">They show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="463">The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="464">While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="465">International exchange of information at level 3</seg>
<seg id="466">International exchange of information in the CR: Procedure</seg>
<seg id="467">International exchange of information helps tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States related to intra-Community business transactions and the taxpayers who carried out these transactions.</seg>
<seg id="468">Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 makes a distinction between two basic categories of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and exchange of information without a prior request.</seg>
<seg id="469">International exchange of information on request is performed through a “request for information” (hereinafter “RFI”) using the standardised SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="470">Tax administrators in the CR communicate their RFI or answer a delivered RFI via the financial directorate to the CLO, which provides for translation of information entered in the standardised SCAC forms into the foreign language and their sending to other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="471">The CLO also provides for receipt of RFI from other Member States and answers to sent RFI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the competent local tax administrators for processing.</seg>
<seg id="472">Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 stipulates that the maximum period of time for processing RFI is 3 months from receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="473">All RFI submitted during the audited period between the CR and Germany were subjected to SAO audit.</seg>
<seg id="474">Out of the total number of 94 RFI received in the CR from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the set three-month deadline; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and, in the remaining 1 case, an answer had not been sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.</seg>
<seg id="475">More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI received from Germany were sent from the CR is contained in Graph No. 2.</seg>
<seg id="476">Of the total number of 335 RFI sent from the CR to Germany, an answer was sent in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the set three-month deadline, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and, in 19 cases, an answer had not been sent from Germany at the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to identify on the basis of the data provided when the answer was delivered from Germany).</seg>
<seg id="477">More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI were furnished from Germany to the CR is contained in Graph No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="478">The percentages of the values of intra-Community transactions stated in RFI submitted between the CR and Germany are disclosed in Graph No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="479">The above graph illustrates that the value of business transactions reviewed through RFI was most frequently in the range above EUR 60,000.</seg>
<seg id="480">International exchange of information without a prior request occurs either by means of automatic or structured-automatic exchange of information, or by spontaneous exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="481">Tax administrators from other Member States often received information that might be important for VAT administration without a previous request.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the CR, all the information is collected at the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="483">Information is transferred electronically between the individual Member States.</seg>
<seg id="484">“Automatic exchange” pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 refers to systematic communication of prespecified information to other Member States, without a prior request and at preset regular intervals.</seg>
<seg id="485">“Structured-automatic exchange” refers to systematic communication of pre-specified information to other Member States without a previous request as soon as the relevant information is available.</seg>
<seg id="486">The CR provides other Member States with information on supply of new means of transport via automatic exchange.</seg>
<seg id="487">This information is available for the tax administrator from the form Report of the supply of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.</seg>
<seg id="488">In processing this form, the tax administrator enters the necessary data in a specially created template and immediately submits this to the contact employee at the financial directorate, where these data are collected and submitted to the CLO for subsequent processing. Then they are transferred to other Member States within a set deadline, i.e. by the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which these data were available.</seg>
<seg id="489">The CR also provides the other Member States with information on mail-order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on operations within the EC that seem unauthorised and information on potential “missing traders”.</seg>
<seg id="490">Such information is sent to other Member States via spontaneous exchange using a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="491">International exchange of information in Germany: Procedure</seg>
<seg id="492">In Germany the local tax office in charge initiates both requests for information and spontaneous information.</seg>
<seg id="493">The tax office sends the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tax offices are instructed to write their requests for information or their spontaneous information only in German; even the used SCAC form is monolingual.</seg>
<seg id="495">Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of an intra-Community acquisition in the other Member State and prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State respectively.</seg>
<seg id="496">When the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks the amount of supplies mentioned in the request for the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="497">If there is no adequate reason for the request, the German CLO declines any request for an amount below this threshold.</seg>
<seg id="498">Furthermore, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor English.</seg>
<seg id="499">To answer the requests for information the CLO sends the request to the tax office in charge referring to the 3-month-time-limit.</seg>
<seg id="500">There are no other deadlines set for processing the request on specific organisational levels of the tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="501">Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor the elapsed time limits, it lacks the staff capacity to remind the tax offices of answering the incomplete requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="502">The tax offices get the information required by sending a letter to the taxpayers or by conducting an audit.</seg>
<seg id="503">The auditors usually chose between two different types of audits: A special VAT audit which covers any taxable process of a period of some months or a so called VAT inspection which can cover only one transaction which has been done recently.</seg>
<seg id="504">This short and ﬂexible kind of audit does not require any notification of the taxpayer and it has been of merits to investigate a single taxable transaction.</seg>
<seg id="505">In the context of the automatic exchange without a prior request Germany provides other Member States with information – about VAT IDs granted to entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States, – about the refund of input tax to those entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="506">Furthermore, Germany has committed itself to providing other EC Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:</seg>
<seg id="507">a. The supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. supplies by distance or catalogue selling to other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between the intra-Community acquisitions declared by a taxpayer and the VIES data submitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community supplies of goods which the German taxpayer did not report in RS, because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions, e. potential “missing trader” which made intra-Community transactions independent of the validity of their VAT ID and f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential “missing traders” or recipients who misused their VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="508">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="509">Sending of RFI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the CR and Germany by competent local tax offices that send filed SCAC forms to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="510">While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (CzechEnglish) and translates dispatched information into English or German language, respectively, German tax offices comply with the instruction, according to which they have to write RFI or spontaneous information exclusively in German on a single-language form.</seg>
<seg id="511">The German CLO does not provide a translation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="512">When reviewing RFIs transmitted between the CR and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration settled 74,5 % of received RFIs in a given three months deadline, while RFIs sent to Germany were settled by the German tax administration in the given deadline in 40,6 % cases only.</seg>
<seg id="513">Although the German CLO refers the tax offices to the 3-month-deadline it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.</seg>
<seg id="514">The outcome of the missing reminders is the high quantity of delayed answers to RFIs.</seg>
<seg id="515">Because of these problems the BRH recommended a steady reminding exercise of the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="516">The situation has already improved.</seg>
<seg id="517">According to our latest information the German CLO now reminds the Tos tax offices of answering the incompleted requests for information.</seg>
<seg id="518">VAT risk management</seg>
<seg id="519">Risk management in the CR</seg>
<seg id="520">In the CR, several units at various organisational levels of the tax administration are concerned with VAT risk management.</seg>
<seg id="521">Within the MoF, the following units are concerned with the aspect of risk management and combating VAT fraud:</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT Methodology and Performance Department and, in its framework, the VAT Risk Management Unit that, i.a., manages the selection of risks of potential tax evasion and evaluates trends in these risks at a domestic and community level.</seg>
<seg id="523">Nationally it coordinates the performance of the task of “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” and VIES data utilisation from the standpoint of tax evasion as part of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="524">On the basis of data on the trade balance of the CR it evaluates risky commodities, prepares VAT risk management conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and with other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="525">The Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration that, i.a., provides for exchange of information in the area of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of an information database, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides for informing the public and for other forms of international cooperation in the sense of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="526">The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="527">These data are contained in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="528">They show significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="529">The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="530">While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.</seg>
<seg id="531">The Methodology of Tax Control and Investigation Department that, i.a., performs risk analysis as part of methodological management of tax audits and, in accordance with risk analysis, establishes priorities for orientation of tax audits in the plans of the financial directorates, prepares risk analyses as part of reducing tax evasions including the collection of information obtained in tax administration and from other sources and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="532">Investigation departments are established at the financial directorates and, i.a., look for tax entities and high-risk areas regarding tax fraud (i.e. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), look for unregistered tax entities from the standpoint of tax evasion (e.g. in the area of internet services, mediation of work, radio and printing services, etc.), analysis of connections in chain frauds and provision of information to local financial authorities.</seg>
<seg id="533">Specialised audit departments have been established at 12 selected tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="534">They have regional competence and perform tax audits outside the territorial competence of the tax offices on the basis of authorization.</seg>
<seg id="535">The need to establish specialised tax audit departments followed from the increasing number of determined new and advanced types of tax evasions that occurred particularly amongst entities connected in chains.</seg>
<seg id="536">This department concentrates on audit of tax entities according to the requirements of the investigation departments, tax entities with specific activities and international companies and tax entities with a large scope of activities as regards the magnitude of turnover.</seg>
<seg id="537">The following mechanisms used to reduce risks in the area of VAT were integrated into the ATIS system: – the task “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” for evaluating the risk level of submitted tax returns, – the task “Choice of tax entities for inspection”, enabling selection of taxpayers for audit on the basis of selected criteria, – the task “VIES”, through which the tax administrators have access to data provided from the other EC Member States.</seg>
<seg id="538">The task “VIES” permits, i.a.: – verifying the validity of VAT ID of taxpayers from other Member States, – obtaining from other Member States the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer, declared in the RS by all its suppliers in other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers who did not submit RS, – performance of formal control of data that taxpayers in the CR entered in RS prior to sending these data to other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers for which data on supply of goods to other Member States entered in their VAT returns does not coincide with RS data, – generating a list of taxpayers, for which the value of goods acquired from other Member States entered in VAT returns do not coincide with the data declared in the RS of all his suppliers from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="539">As part of activities to reduce the risk of tax evasion, tax staff have access to the registers of the state administrative authorities, such as the commercial index, real estate register, motor vehicle register, business license register, etc.</seg>
<seg id="540">More detailed information is provided in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="541">Risk management in Germany</seg>
<seg id="542">Because of the federal structure in Germany both the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states participate in the development and the operation of RMSs.</seg>
<seg id="543">Although there are joint working groups for the development neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states share a completely consistent database.</seg>
<seg id="544">At the level of the CLO unit ST I 2 (hereinafter the “KUSS“ – coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a separate database called OPUS.</seg>
<seg id="545">KUSS established another database called ZAUBER in cooperation with the tax offices to communicate the names of discovered “missing traders” or VAT fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="546">KUSS coordinates both connected cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="547">The experience gathered by KUSS is incorporated into the development of RMS in the working groups.</seg>
<seg id="548">Furthermore, experts of several other units of the CLO and the MoF are entrusted with RMS duties and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="549">At the level of the CLO, a formal control is done of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in submitted RS of German taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="550">This formal control is processed before RS data are submitted to other Member States to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data submitted (see 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="551">The verification of VAT IDs mentioned in RS is proven on the basis of O_MCTL-Codes submitted by other Member States (for the process of correcting an invalid VAT ID see also 4.4.2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Furthermore, the RMS of the CLO is based on the VIES data transmitted by other Member States and it creates several types of inspection notes based on several characteristics usually found in carousel transactions to detect a potential “missing trader”.</seg>
<seg id="553">The tax offices of the federal states are instructed to process these inspection notes and in some cases to report the result of their investigation to the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="554">The audit findings of the BRH confirmed that it is necessary to include all available characteristics in order to be able to assume a case of tax fraud with a sufficient probability (instead of focussing on a company’s turnover only).</seg>
<seg id="555">So the BRH suggested to the MoF to imply a mix of diverse characteristics for producing the reports.</seg>
<seg id="556">The RMS should include other facts like the taxpayer’s payment behaviour, the (economic) branch or the shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="557">A second level of RMS is processed by the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on processing of VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="558">RMS for example generates a list of those taxpayers who declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="559">This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of RS.</seg>
<seg id="560">Furthermore, this type of RMS compares the intra-Community acquisitions declared in the taxpayer’s annual VAT return with the data of the VIES-system.</seg>
<seg id="561">The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data because this comparison would disclose too many mismatches which may attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:</seg>
<seg id="562">– differing times when the supplier and the acquirer thought the intra-Community transaction was carried out;</seg>
<seg id="563">– differing accounting and declaring of sales discounts and incentives.</seg>
<seg id="564">In addition to comparing the VAT return data and VIES data many federal states implemented components of RMS based on the data of VAT returns, and some other facts (like the composition of the firm‘s name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayer’s payment behaviour).</seg>
<seg id="565">Bavaria implemented a rule-based RMS, permitting a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter the risk managers) to program their own rules to identify potential tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="566">This RMS is applied when the tax offices are processing the monthly VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="567">So the tax office in charge receives suspected cases of the RMS before the VAT is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="568">Since this RMS is not able to learn the risk managers have to adjust the rules on the basis of the feedback of the tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive neural network with the data of tax files in which an audit disclosed tax evasions.</seg>
<seg id="570">Based on these data the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="571">The RMS produces a list of tax files monthly, which are suspected of being involved in tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="572">On the basis of this list the tax offices in charge decide to audit the proposed taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="573">After the audit the auditors have to report their findings, so the RMS can learn from the results of its list.</seg>
<seg id="574">North-Rhine Westphalia uses an adaptive neural network which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy-system.</seg>
<seg id="575">Based on many data of assessed VAT returns and some other facts this neuro-fuzzy- or data mining system calculates the probability that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="576">Afterwards it produces a monthly list of potential tax fraudsters.</seg>
<seg id="577">Based on this list the local tax offices choose relevant taxpayers for an audit and report the audit findings to the data processing centre.</seg>
<seg id="578">The implementation of any of these three RMS in other federal states is in progress.</seg>
<seg id="579">Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach a combination of all the systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="580">It will remain to be seen if such a system achieves the expected results.</seg>
<seg id="581">Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="582">Although specific criteria of the RMS of CR and Germany could not be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.</seg>
<seg id="583">Like the different approaches of the three federal states in Germany the RMS of each European state has its own strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="584">The tax authorities of the European Member States currently discuss new tendencies and new models of crossborder VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="585">VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – did not turn out to be a national but a European problem rather.</seg>
<seg id="586">Taxpayers involved in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several states.</seg>
<seg id="587">An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State only.</seg>
<seg id="588">Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS.</seg>
<seg id="589">VAT loss caused by the Europe-wide fraud need not to affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="590">Each Member State that is involved in the fraudulent activities can be affected.</seg>
<seg id="591">So there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.</seg>
<seg id="592">Selected audit findings on verification of commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="593">As part of the parallel audits the SAO and BRH reviewed the quality and use of information on selected business transactions that were subject to international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="594">In addition, the two audit institutions jointly reviewed several business transactions where there were doubts about their execution or discrepancies in the manner in which taxpayers in the two countries reported such business transactions in their VAT returns or RS.</seg>
<seg id="595">At the request of the BRH, the SAO reviewed a total of 8 cases related to business transactions performed between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="596">In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notification by the BRH, the SAO reviewed the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, reported by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and RS.</seg>
<seg id="597">Upon request from the SAO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 cases related to business transactions performed between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="598">Relevant information was exclusively exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 using official communication by the CLO.</seg>
<seg id="599">The review of those selected cases revealed, i.a. that, the different ways of registration in the EC Member States cause problems as mentioned in chapter 4.1:</seg>
<seg id="600">1.</seg>
<seg id="601">According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 60,500.</seg>
<seg id="602">When the Czech taxpayer declared acquisition of goods at a value corresponding to only EUR 29,869 the Czech tax administration sent a request to Germany for verification of the value of the supplied goods.</seg>
<seg id="603">The German party stated in the answer to the RFI delivered from Germany that, in the 2nd quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 27,381, in the 3rd quarter at a value of EUR 31,997 and, in the 4th quarter, at a value of EUR 10,276.</seg>
<seg id="604">It further followed from the answer that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was valid only from 28 September 2004 but, on the basis of an additional request by the German taxpayer for certification of the validity of VAT ID, in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued a certificate with validity of the VAT ID from 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="605">The German taxpayer corrected the RS.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of this information, this was a case of acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="607">Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted additional VAT returns for the individual taxable periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of the goods acquired from other Member States and simultaneously made claims for deduction of VAT on acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="608">However, the Czech tax administrator could not unambiguously determine from these additional VAT returns whether they also include the value of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier.</seg>
<seg id="609">On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.</seg>
<seg id="610">However, because he did not request the allocation of a VAT ID on registration, he was allocated only an identification number for transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="611">Although it is not usually possible to allocate a taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case, in 2006 the German tax official assigned to this German taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively as of 1 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="612">The German CLO allocates a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay of the allocation; for example if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer’s application of a VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="613">In this case the CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not provide an own valid VAT ID for an intra-Community supply according to § 6 UStG.</seg>
<seg id="614">Vice versa a German recipient does not provide a valid VAT ID of his supplier to declare an intra-Community acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="615">Because of these different processes between the Member States the German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.</seg>
<seg id="616">2.</seg>
<seg id="617">As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested review of the VAT registration of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="618">VIES gives a registration date of 5 March 2005, while the date 1 October 2004 is given in the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer issued by the competent local German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="619">The German authorities stated in the answer sent from Germany that the German tax entity was registered on 1 October 2004, but that, for organisational reasons, he was allocated a VAT ID in Germany only on 16 February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="620">Through a question sent to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator performed a VAT audit at the Czech taxpayer for the taxation periods of the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="621">In this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer included in his VAT return services at a value of CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. prior to 1 October 2004).</seg>
<seg id="622">The tax office subsequently assessed VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60) for the tax entity for the taxation period of the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="623">On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the VAT ID was allocated to the German taxpayer only on 16 February 2005, when he informed the tax office about his business which was started in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="624">Furthermore the tax office registered him retroactively for VAT as 1 October 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return of the year 2004.</seg>
<seg id="625">In this VAT return the taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisitions from CR in the amount of EUR 160 (» CZK 5,000).</seg>
<seg id="626">3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and RS for the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer declared the supply of goods at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="627">In reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after supply of the goods to Germany by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="628">The Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared a tax base for performed domestic supplies at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.</seg>
<seg id="629">Through a question to the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for renewal of the proceedings in the matter of the additional VAT return and, as evidence, submitted the statement of the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered for taxes since 1 January 2000.</seg>
<seg id="630">Consequently, the Czech tax administrator reviewed the validity of registration of the German taxpayer as part of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="631">It followed from the answer delivered from Germany that the German taxpayer was allocated a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of supply of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="632">Consequently, the tax administrator in the CR rejected the request for renewal of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="633">The BRH found that, in this case, intra-Community acquisition of goods was not involved because the German taxpayer obtained a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004.</seg>
<seg id="634">However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and he declared VAT on this intra-Community acquisition, as he demanded the refund of the input VAT in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="635">Since there would be no change in VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="636">The BRH further found that the name of the German taxpayer mentioned in the RFI was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, as a consequence of which there was confusion between two German tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="637">This change of the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="638">4.</seg>
<seg id="639">As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005, at a value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="640">Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that this administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer in which he reviewed whether the supply of the goods was performed and whether the Czech taxpayer entered the invoice for these goods in the accounts and paid it.</seg>
<seg id="641">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID in the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German taxpayer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after performance of the supply to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="643">The Czech tax administrator also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer so that, if required, he could take steps to assess taxes.</seg>
<seg id="644">The Czech tax office assessed this business transaction as acquisition of goods from a nontaxpayer in Germany and thus did not subsequently assess taxes for the Czech taxpayer from this business transaction.</seg>
<seg id="645">The BRH found that, according to the German legislation, for a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States there is no need for a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="646">The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the acquirer in the other Member State and must be capable of demonstrating transport of the given goods to the other Member State.</seg>
<seg id="647">Thus, according to the German VAT law, this was an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="648">Anyway it is important that the Czech tax administrator took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of that value was not the German supplier’s core business.</seg>
<seg id="649">As described in chapter 4.6.2 the German CLO declines to answer RFIs which are applied to intra-Community transactions if the amount is less than the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000:</seg>
<seg id="650">5. According to VIES data in the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods from the German taxpayer at a value of EUR 12,561.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Czech tax administrator performed a tax audit of the tax entity for this taxable period.</seg>
<seg id="652">As part of international cooperation, the Czech tax administration requested review of supply of these goods via a SCAC form.</seg>
<seg id="653">The Czech taxpayer stated that he did not receive the goods, that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of these goods was not entered in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="654">The German tax administration rejected the request for provision of evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, stating that the turnover did not exceed the amount of EUR 15,000 and no other explanations were given.</seg>
<seg id="655">As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence for retrospective tax assessment on the goods acquired, the tax audit ended without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="656">On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a “fiscal representative” (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).</seg>
<seg id="657">The German taxpayer reported these supplies in its annual VAT return and in the RS.</seg>
<seg id="658">His right to exemption of the supplies was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="659">On the basis of notification by the BRH, the German tax office will send documents to the CR, required for subsequent assessment of taxes on the acquired goods.</seg>
<seg id="660">It was shown in chapter 4.6.1 that replies to RFIs sent by the German tax administration exceeded the 3-monthtime limit more often than replies of the Czech tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="661">6. SAO found in the audit that, on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany, related to reviewing the value of goods supplied in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="662">In the RS for this period, the German taxpayer declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the value of EUR 86,307; however, for the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared in the VAT return only the acquisition of goods for a value corresponding to EUR 35,314.</seg>
<seg id="663">In the answer to the RFI delivered to the CR on 9 May 2006, i.e. following expiry of the deadline for processing, stipulated in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the request could not be processed, as the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="664">Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the RFI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for the tax proceedings in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="665">7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested - via a SCAC form - review of a supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 1,265,554, performed in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004 since the transaction showed characteristics of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="666">The SAO found that an answer to the RFI had not been received from Germany at the time of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="667">Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer did not include in his VAT return the supplies of new means of transportation for this German taxpayer at a value of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 37 5,472).</seg>
<seg id="668">The Czech tax administrator corrected the tax return information and the Czech tax entity submitted a corrected RS.</seg>
<seg id="669">On the basis of the request by the SAO, the BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO did not transfer this RFI to the competent local tax office for review.</seg>
<seg id="670">Following notification by the BRH, an audit was performed at the German acquirer in Germany, which provided evidence that the acquisition of all the automobiles was properly taxed and that the relevant automobiles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="671">8. According to VIES data in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car from the German taxpayer, at a value of EUR 48,500.</seg>
<seg id="672">The Czech taxpayer did not declare acquisition of these goods.</seg>
<seg id="673">In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer has not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Czech taxpayer did not submit tax returns even after being invited to do so by the tax administrator; consequently, on 23 May 2005, the tax office assessed VAT for the period from October to December 2004 in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="675">On 2 June 2005, the CLO referred to this supply from a German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="676">Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the administrator sent a RFI to Germany in relation to the above-mentioned supply.</seg>
<seg id="677">As the answer to the RFI was delivered only on 7 February 2007, it was not known by the time of completion of the SAO’s audit in which way the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.</seg>
<seg id="678">Because of failure to comply with obligations following from the Act on VAT, registration for VAT was cancelled for the Czech taxpayer as of 23 August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="679">In some cases only a partial reply was sent because the audit carried out by tax offices at taxpayers was not finished at the time of the audit of the SAO and BRH:</seg>
<seg id="680">9.</seg>
<seg id="681">In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 16,991 performed in the 3rd quarter of 2004, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="682">In his answer to the RFI, the German tax administrator stated that he had available only the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies at a value of EUR 16,335.</seg>
<seg id="683">On the basis of the request from the SAO, the BRH found that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="684">The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods at a value of EUR 16,335 twice, in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="685">10.</seg>
<seg id="686">In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supplies of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 198,167, performed in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.</seg>
<seg id="687">The German tax administration sent a partial answer to the RFI to the CR, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer acquired several automobiles and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="688">The SAO found that the competent local tax office performed several local investigations at the Czech supplier for the purpose of reviewing the claim of excessive VAT deductions, in which it did not find unauthorised claiming.</seg>
<seg id="689">The BRH found that in this period the German taxpayer declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579,114 and that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany has still not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="690">In chapter 4.4.1 the reasons of mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient’s VAT return and the data of the RS of the supplier are described.</seg>
<seg id="691">The audited cases showed that temporary mismatches or the improper declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community supply of goods in RS were not the most frequent causes for the deviations:</seg>
<seg id="692">11.</seg>
<seg id="693">According to data from the VIES system, in the 1st quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods at a value of EUR 35,716 from the German taxpayer; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="694">Since the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and no activities were performed in the registered seat of the company, the Czech tax administrator requested, as part of international exchange of information, review of the way in which the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="695">The answer to the RFI delivered from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and an agreed transporter accepted the goods.</seg>
<seg id="696">The order was for the total sum of EUR 155,000 but the German taxpayer supplied only goods at a value of EUR 21,659.</seg>
<seg id="697">The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer false confirmation of payment of the sum of EUR 155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="698">Following identification of the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to reobtain the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of one item at a value of EUR 7,916.</seg>
<seg id="699">Through an inquiry at the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the tax administration, i.a., on the basis of the obtained information, subsequently assessed the Czech taxpayer VAT for the goods acquired from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).</seg>
<seg id="700">On the basis of an inquiry from the SAO, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of only EUR 7,916.</seg>
<seg id="701">According to the German legal situation the German taxpayer declared the reclaim of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter of the reclaim.</seg>
<seg id="702">So his RS contained the following declarations concerning the Czech taxpayer:</seg>
<seg id="703">12.</seg>
<seg id="704">As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, through a SCAC form, review of supply of goods and provision of services, performed in the 3rd quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="705">According to this RFI in this period, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer at a total value of EUR 396,126 and had provided services at a value of EUR 11,885.</seg>
<seg id="706">The SAO found that the Czech tax administration performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing this supply.</seg>
<seg id="707">In response to the RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with a production line, including assembly.</seg>
<seg id="708">The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production line prior to accession of the CR to the EC and the line was assembled after May 1, 2004 on the basis of an order.</seg>
<seg id="709">The German taxpayer did not accept the assembled line because of asserted defects.</seg>
<seg id="710">In the 3rd quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer issued an invoice to the German taxpayer for the sum of EUR 107,100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The German taxpayer accepted the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.</seg>
<seg id="712">Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that all the invoices were properly entered in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="713">VAT returns for the 3rd quarter of 2005 contain only those amounts that were documented by the Czech taxpayer and that were related to invoicing after May 1, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="714">The BRH found that, on the basis of the answer from the Czech tax administration, the competent local tax office arrived at the conclusion that those transactions were a consistent supply of goods from the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer including the service of the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="715">In this special case, the place of this so-called work supply is where the production line is assembled.</seg>
<seg id="716">The German recipient of the work supply is obliged to pay the VAT according to the German VAT law.</seg>
<seg id="717">Simultaneously, the recipient may apply for deduction of VAT in the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="718">As there would be no changes in the VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, corrections in the tax return were neglected by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="719">13. According to VIES data, in February 2005 Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine from German taxpayer C at a value of EUR 58,000.</seg>
<seg id="720">The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany for review of this information.</seg>
<seg id="721">In answer to the RFI, the German party stated that German taxpayer C supplied that machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he returned the machine to German taxpayer C in October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="722">According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transferred back to Germany, but was transported to the organisational unit of German taxpayer C in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="723">It further followed from the answer to the RFI that, in February 2005, German taxpayer C sold the machine to Czech taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="724">This taxpayer received the machine in the seat of the organisational unit of the German taxpayer in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="725">As the supply was performed only within the CR, this did not constitute an intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="726">By means of a question to the tax administrator in charge of taxpayer B, the SAO found that according to VIES data, German taxpayer C supplied goods to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004 (another machine), at a value of EUR 88,027.</seg>
<seg id="727">Taxpayer B stated that he did not receive these goods and these the competent local tax administrator in the CR sent a RFI to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="728">According to the answer to this request, the machine was supplied.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a further investigation at taxpayer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 was not entered in the accounts of taxpayer B and that this could be a machine of the same kind as was supplied by the organisational unit of German taxpayer C to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="730">The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator competent local for taxpayer A performed a local investigation concerning this taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="731">The tax administrator had the invoice of German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which taxpayer A is stated as the customer for the machine.</seg>
<seg id="732">The Czech tax administrator found that taxpayer A had not entered this invoice in his accounts.</seg>
<seg id="733">Taxpayer A had concluded a leasing agreement with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same kind.</seg>
<seg id="734">The leasing company supplied the machine on 9 February 2005 and the leasing company provided for the transport of the machine.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Czech tax office failed to use the information contained in the answer to the request for information for assessing the tax obligation of taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="736">The BRH found that German taxpayer C did not supply the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 to the CR, but to another German taxpayer D.</seg>
<seg id="737">Thus, this did not constitute intra-Community supply of goods, but taxable supply in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="738">Consequently, the German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of German taxpayer C to exemption from VAT and corrected the data in his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="739">The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="741">BRH further found that, in his RS for the 1st quarter of 2005, German taxpayer C entered the supply of a machine at a value of EUR 58,000 to Czech taxpayer A.</seg>
<seg id="742">This supply was not reviewed during the tax audit performed by the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="743">The following figure shows the contractual relationships between participants of the above mentioned business transactions.</seg>
<seg id="744">14.</seg>
<seg id="745">Auditing received RFIs, SAO found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received an RFI from Germany, in which a German tax administrator requested confirmation of intra-Community supply from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="746">According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that that was a case of fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.</seg>
<seg id="747">It was further stated in the RFI that the German taxpayer had not done any active business since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="748">SAO stated that the Czech tax administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="749">The executive of the Czech company stated that the above-mentioned case was probably a claim of the German taxpayer in relation to the German tax administration that was set up by the Czech taxpayer as a shareholder in the German company at the German tax office.</seg>
<seg id="750">According to information provided to the SAO, to the present time the Czech tax administrator has not had any information that the German tax administration is processing the matter in relation to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="751">The available information indicates that this was not a case of supply of goods; nonetheless, this value is still included in the VIES system as intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech taxpayer from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="752">The most important reason for those discrepancies was that the recipients did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):</seg>
<seg id="753">15. According to the VIES data, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer in a total value of EUR 33,205 in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="754">The Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Czech tax administrator requested review of the supply of the goods from Germany as part of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="756">In its answer to this request, the German party stated that the German taxpayer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the Czech taxpayer picked up the remaining goods in person.</seg>
<seg id="757">In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, prior to obtaining an answer to the RFI, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for this period.</seg>
<seg id="758">In spite of this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved and thus the Czech tax administrator recommended that a tax audit be performed at the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="759">The audit has not been carried out yet.</seg>
<seg id="760">16. According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004 a German taxpayer supplied to a Czech taxpayer goods at a value of EUR 46,854.</seg>
<seg id="761">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisition of goods only in an amount corresponding to the sum of EUR 14,856.</seg>
<seg id="762">As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator asked for a review of the amount of the actual supply.</seg>
<seg id="763">In the response to this request delivered from Germany, 3 invoices were provided, with a total stated value of supplied goods of EUR 31,999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the data in the VIES system.</seg>
<seg id="764">In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, following receipt of the answer from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and they agreed that, after reviewing these invoices with the owner of the company, she would discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="765">By now, the additional tax return was not submitted.</seg>
<seg id="766">The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that he would proceed so as to comply with the set deadlines for any retroactive assessment of VAT for the relevant taxation period.</seg>
<seg id="767">17.</seg>
<seg id="768">In the 4th quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 11,600.</seg>
<seg id="769">As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech taxpayer actually existed, because the alleged shareholder of the German taxpayer established a number of fictitious companies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="770">During reviewing of the business transaction by the tax office, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="771">However, according to a statement by the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the CR and were further sold in Germany during 2005.</seg>
<seg id="772">The Czech taxpayer submitted documents on sale of the goods in January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="773">The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer and did not declare or pay taxes for the sale of the relevant goods neither in the CR nor Germany.</seg>
<seg id="774">All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated these facts to the German tax administration in the answer to the RFI.</seg>
<seg id="775">In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of a performed investigation, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of goods acquired, i.a. from a German taxpayer and simultaneously exercised the right to tax deduction in acquisition of goods from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="776">He did not enter VAT on sale of goods in Germany to the Czech VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Czech tax administrator assessed an additional VAT return following the local investigation without any changes.</seg>
<seg id="778">According to the Czech legislation, the case in question did not consist in acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the CR.</seg>
<seg id="779">Thus, the Czech tax administrator drew an erroneous conclusion in the local investigation.</seg>
<seg id="780">The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the answer to the RFI, stating that the goods did not leave Germany, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and requested payment of VAT of EUR 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="781">Furthermore, the competent tax office sent a hint to the tax office of the real recipient of the goods to ensure that the further sale of these goods is properly taxed.</seg>
<seg id="782">In the following cases taxpayers declared intra-Community transactions, which were probably not realised in fact:</seg>
<seg id="783">18.</seg>
<seg id="784">The Czech tax administrator obtained a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car at a value of EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="785">The request included an annex consisting in a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="786">It also included a copy of the passport of the person who was said to have performed the transport of this automobile.</seg>
<seg id="787">The Czech tax administrator found in the investigation that this was a stolen passport, that the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the CR and he stated that he did not have any contacts with a German tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Czech tax administrator never issued the certificate of VAT registration, whose copy was sent by the German party.</seg>
<seg id="789">The Czech tax administrator entered these data in the answer to the RFI together with the fact that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods – the automobile in question.</seg>
<seg id="790">Through a question to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the executive of the company could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="791">After performance of a tax objection proceeding for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer tax obligation in the amount of CZK 0.</seg>
<seg id="792">In a further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the relevant automobile was sold to a further Czech entity, who purchased it through an Internet advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="793">BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech answer to the RFI, the competent local German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer to VAT exemption for this supply.</seg>
<seg id="794">19. During an audit a German tax office was not able to clarify a difference of EUR 3,000 between the amount of acquired goods declared in the taxpayer’s tax return and the amount submitted from other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="795">A Czech taxpayer was said to have supplied goods at a value of EUR 89,424 to a German taxpayer during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="796">As the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested review of supplies and their payment as part of international exchange of information.</seg>
<seg id="797">In the answer to the RFI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the single executive for the Czech company had been erased from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and a new executive had not been entered.</seg>
<seg id="798">The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative to the shareholder in the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="799">The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a RS that, following deletion of the executive from the Commercial Register, was signed by an unauthorised person – this shareholder in the company.</seg>
<seg id="800">The accountant of the Czech taxpayer told the tax administrator that the shareholder in the company deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR to the account of the company.</seg>
<seg id="801">Cash documents were not drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="802">Through an inquiry to the competent local tax office, the SAO in the CR found that the tax administrator recognised that the Czech taxpayer had the right to exemption from VAT for supply of goods to other Member States in the value of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) for the 1st quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548) for the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="803">The BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer because a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="804">Since the earlier audit did not detect any signs for tax fraud there would not be any chance to recover an assessed VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="805">20. According to VIES data in the year 2005 a German taxpayer acquired goods from CR in the amount of EUR 4,251,196 after he had acquired goods in the amount of EUR 43,274 in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neither in his VAT return of 2004 nor in his VAT return of 2005 did the German taxpayer declare intraCommunity acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="807">Furthermore, he did not declare any proportionate supplies.</seg>
<seg id="808">Because of these differences the German tax office started an RFI concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="809">In the RS for these two quarters a Czech supplier declared intra-Community supplies of goods in a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).</seg>
<seg id="810">On 6 September 2006, the RFI was delivered, in which the German party requested review of whether the intra-Community supply declared by the Czech taxpayer had actually occurred.</seg>
<seg id="811">In the answer to this RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that it was not possible to comply with the German request because the Czech taxpayer did not have an executive.</seg>
<seg id="812">As can be seen from the documents provided to SAO by the relevant tax administrator, a protocol was drawn up with the executive of the Czech taxpayer on 30 March 2006 on commencement of VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and for January to December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="813">The taxpayer was simultaneously invited by the tax administrator to submit all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but he did not submit any documents.</seg>
<seg id="814">According to the Commercial Register, the functional term of the sole executive ended as of 16 May 2005 but a new executive was not appointed.</seg>
<seg id="815">The Czech taxpayer ceased submitting VAT returns in April 2006.</seg>
<seg id="816">As part of this audit, the SAO reviewed jointly with the BRH several cases of intra-Community supplies performed between the CR and Germany that were not subject to previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="817">The two supreme audit institutions shared information on the reviewed cases via CLO of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="818">21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it was going to accomplish taxable transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="819">Because of this information the company has been registered since June 2005 but it did not get a German VAT ID.</seg>
<seg id="820">The (eCR) accepted an order of a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) to manufacture several wind power stations and to deliver those wind power stations on behalf, at risk and for account of the Danish customer to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="821">For lack of sufficient capacities of its own the Czech company passed a part of the order to a German taxpayer (eD) who is resident in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="822">The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the way of transport of the wind power stations:</seg>
<seg id="823">According to the German legal situation the place of these transactions has to be determined as described in the following:</seg>
<seg id="824">– The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind power stations for assembly in his name, at his risk and for his own account to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="825">Because of the assembly his supply takes place in Austria – the supply of the wind power stations is taxable in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="826">– Since the forwarding agent was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport was on his behalf, on his risk and for his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) takes place where the transport started – in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="827">Although the wind power stations have been sent to another EC Member State (A) and the recipient is a registered taxpayer of an EC Member State (CR) the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not gain any tax exemption because the EC Member State of destination differs from the EC Member State of the residence of the Czech company.</seg>
<seg id="828">So this supply is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCR) deducted the input VAT in its tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="829">The place of the supply of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by where the transport started.</seg>
<seg id="830">However the transport of some wind power stations started in the CR and of some others in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="831">– The supply of those wind power stations, which are manufactured in the CR, takes place in the CR.</seg>
<seg id="832">– The supply of the other wind power stations, which are manufactured in Germany, takes place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="833">So the Czech company (eCR) delivered both intra-Community supplies from the CR to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="834">The BRH found that neither the Czech company (eCR) declared any intra-Community acquisitions in its German tax return nor submitted a RS to the German CLO.</seg>
<seg id="835">So it may be possible that the Czech company declared all the intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the CR.</seg>
<seg id="836">The SAO found that the eCR did not declare any intra-Community supplies to Austria but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="837">To provide evidence for the taxation of the intra-Community acquisitions in Austria the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, the Czech, the Danish and the German) would be required although that case does not show any sign of tax fraud or of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="838">Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH reviewed transactions to show the size of the differences between the declarations in the VAT return and the VIES data caused by the different legal provisions of VAT in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="839">The reviewed cases demonstrate also that a change in these legal provisions takes time until the taxpayers and the tax offices apply the new legislation:</seg>
<seg id="840">22. In the RS for the 2nd to 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer declared supply of goods to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).</seg>
<seg id="841">In the same period, another Czech taxpayer declared in its RS intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total amount of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).</seg>
<seg id="842">Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="843">Both Czech taxpayers stated the above-mentioned supplies in their RS in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="844">In a further review of these transactions, an audit group from the SAO found that there were differences in legislation on supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the CR and Germany in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="845">While, in the CR, taxpayers declared the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the applicable statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as intra-Community supply of goods, on the basis of German legislation applicable in 2004, this did not correspond to intra-Community acquisition of goods, but rather to taxable transaction with place of transaction in the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="846">Differences in the legislation were eliminated in the CR by adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll. amending some laws to comply with the administrative fees act effective as from 1 January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="847">23. A review of selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with the BRH, showed that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) in his RS for the 1st and 4th quarters of 2005, and that another Czech taxpayer declared, in the RS for the same period, intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).</seg>
<seg id="848">Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.</seg>
<seg id="849">Pursuant to statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective as from 1 January 2005, in the case of supply of electrical energy, the place of transaction is the place where the acquirer has his registered office, the place of business or where he has his commercial premises for which these goods are supplied.</seg>
<seg id="850">Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have entered the supplies of electrical energy in their RS in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="851">The fact that both taxpayers declared intra-Community supply of electricity in their RS led to distortion of data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).</seg>
<seg id="852">Conclusion</seg>
<seg id="853">The cooperation achieved the objectives of BRH and SAO.</seg>
<seg id="854">Both SAI obtained a deeper knowledge of the systems of administration of VAT in the CR and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="855">The cooperation revealed differences of the two systems and disclosed that the legal provisions governing VAT administration vary.</seg>
<seg id="856">During the parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.</seg>
<seg id="857">Some of them merit further review.</seg>
<seg id="858">On the basis of audit findings, both SAI produced recommendations on VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="859">To monitor implementation of these recommendations and to review the above mentioned cases a follow-up audit should be conducted..</seg>
<seg id="860">The new experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of both audit institutions are the basis for successful accomplishment of future audit missions of VAT administration.</seg>

<seg id="2">A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.</seg>
<seg id="5">While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.</seg>
<seg id="6">China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="8">China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."</seg>
<seg id="9">"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="1">Just after midnight Monday, federal spending started to drop by $16 billion.</seg>
<seg id="2">What do you say we all close down the poker game, go home and bank the $16 billion?</seg>
<seg id="3">That's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting, and we think he deserves as much support as he can get.</seg>
<seg id="4">If human beings can't cut federal spending honestly -- and they can't -- let the computers do it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Congress, with a measure of White House complicity, has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills. (Indeed without earlier manipulations, the current sequester of $16 billion would have been even larger.) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Consider, for instance, that even yesterday's widely publicized sequester is likely to be traduced if business as usual is allowed to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the law, Gramm-Rudman's across-the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the Associated Press's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment: "Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Darman's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater: "There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go.</seg>
<seg id="11">It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion." This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk.</seg>
<seg id="12">It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid, unserious presidency.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats, the lobbyists, the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ask Tommy Lasorda; thin is in.</seg>
<seg id="15">Senator Phil Gramm pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985, federal spending grew by about 11% a year; since the law, it's grown at under 5% annually.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes.</seg>
<seg id="17">George Bush's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities, rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough.</seg>
<seg id="18">If Washington's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam, Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs, such as federalized child care.</seg>
<seg id="19">Child care was one of the many "extraneous" bills pulled out of the Senate's reconciliation bill last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Others were the capital-gains cut, Section 89 repeal, the disabled workers bill, and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act.</seg>
<seg id="21">All this stuff still is in the House's 1,878-page reconciliation bill, and many Members say they're reluctant to pull out cherished bills, just to see them die.</seg>
<seg id="22">Republicans especially want a guarantee from the House leadership that they'll get an up-or-down vote on the bills.</seg>
<seg id="23">House Speaker Foley ought to deliver that promise.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is the way government is supposed to work, with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify, instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy, breezy days in Washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build, roads paved, soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those days are gone.</seg>
<seg id="27">Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="28">Save the sequester, and let Washington scream.</seg>

<seg id="1">Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn</seg>
<seg id="2">As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.</seg>
<seg id="9">"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.</seg>
<seg id="10">But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."</seg>
<seg id="11">Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook</seg>
<seg id="2">Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.</seg>
<seg id="3">The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's a historical moment."</seg>
<seg id="8">The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.</seg>
<seg id="9">It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="11">What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."</seg>
<seg id="13">The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.</seg>
<seg id="16">Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are not asking their permission."</seg>
<seg id="18">In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</seg>
<seg id="20">In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.</seg>

<seg id="2">The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.</seg>
<seg id="5">A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."</seg>
<seg id="8">He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.</seg>
<seg id="10">Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.</seg>
<seg id="12">Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."</seg>

<seg id="2">Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.</seg>
<seg id="4">At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.</seg>
<seg id="6">One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.</seg>
<seg id="8">""Peppa the pig," yes."</seg>
<seg id="9">Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.</seg>

<seg id="14">We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.</seg>

<seg id="2">Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."</seg>
<seg id="5">He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="9">He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="10">The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."</seg>
<seg id="12">The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.</seg>
<seg id="15">The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="18">My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."</seg>
<seg id="19">His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is in response to Atsushi Kageyama's Manager's Journal, "Looking for the Real Thing in Sony" (editorial page, Oct. 2).</seg>
<seg id="2">Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama's comments, I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction: It isn't the Americans who must be criticized for not understanding the Japanese culture, but the Japanese who insist on forcing their culture on Americans.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japanese want us to accept their culture, but they refuse to accept the American culture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Japanese managers can't expect Americans to behave as if they were Japanese; instead, they must manage Americans as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Americans are expected to conform to the Japanese culture when in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="6">What is wrong with expecting the Japanese to conform to American norms when they locate here?</seg>
<seg id="7">Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas.</seg>
<seg id="8">European multinationals do likewise; even in America, their affiliates are usually run by American managers.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the Japanese insist upon Japanese managers everywhere they set up shop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do the Japanese feel so superior that they cannot find capable American managers?</seg>
<seg id="11">Paul A. Herbig</seg>
<seg id="12">Indiana University</seg>
<seg id="13">Bloomington, Ind.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Kageyama suggests that Kotobuki Electronics Industries workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses' perspective.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences, both cultural and philosophic, I question his perspective.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses' culture and philosophy?</seg>
<seg id="17">Obviously not.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating.</seg>
<seg id="19">The workers can be motivated, and the company reach its full potential, only when management embraces the employees' perspective.</seg>
<seg id="20">A. Lawton Langford</seg>
<seg id="21">President</seg>
<seg id="22">Municipal Code Corp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tallahassee, Fla.</seg>
<seg id="24">I believe Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece: the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others.</seg>
<seg id="25">A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management.</seg>
<seg id="26">Instead, he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates.</seg>
<seg id="27">Japanese culture vs.</seg>
<seg id="28">American culture is irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="29">The key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Mr. Kageyama to argue that American employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr. Kageyama is accurate to deny a specific anti-American bias.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is more difficult to deny a general bigotry in seeing things only the Japanese way.</seg>
<seg id="34">When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism, I am convinced that Mr. Kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday</seg>
<seg id="2">American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.</seg>
<seg id="6">And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.</seg>
<seg id="13">I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.</seg>
<seg id="14">He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="16">It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He provides a lot more than just play."</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear</seg>
<seg id="2">Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.</seg>
<seg id="4">"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.</seg>
<seg id="5">So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.</seg>
<seg id="6">You go full bore tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Get out there and do all the right things.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not over till you've got the points on the board.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.</seg>
<seg id="10">I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."</seg>
<seg id="11">Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tomorrow's a different beast.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."</seg>
<seg id="19">"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.</seg>
<seg id="21">When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.</seg>
<seg id="22">We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."</seg>
<seg id="23">Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.</seg>

<seg id="1">We're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr. Allen, appointed by President Reagan, grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="3">His recent speech, provocatively titled "Blacks?</seg>
<seg id="4">Animals?</seg>
<seg id="5">Homosexuals?</seg>
<seg id="6">What is a Minority?" caused an uproar when its title leaked out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Allen's commissioners voted to call his unread speech "thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory." Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman." Rep. Don Edwards, the California Democrat, warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be "outside the scope of the commission's jurisdiction." Thomas Stoddard, head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, called the prospect of the speech "frankly shocking."</seg>
<seg id="8">We've actually read the speech.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts, a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said that other participants in the conference "do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual," but that "I mean to persuade you to the opposite view."</seg>
<seg id="11">He recalled to the audience a "strange, infelicitous" analogy he once heard arguing "now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights, we need to do the same for animals." Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to "assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity, of humaneness." Rights on such a basis, whether for blacks or homosexuals, are "mere indulgences," he said, subject to being taken back.</seg>
<seg id="12">He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals, not as members of certain select groups.</seg>
<seg id="13">His speech criticized the "idiocy of notions of protected groups in society" as opposed to individual equality or, as he put it, in "a common destiny as Americans." Instead of lobbying for special treatment, Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk "invidious retrenchment with government complicity."</seg>
<seg id="14">This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed.</seg>
<seg id="15">What's really going on here?</seg>
<seg id="16">The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal establishment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Allen, who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated the vague concept of "Indian rights" above the rights of individual Indians.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, the gap is so large that Mr. Allen's critics refuse to engage the debate.</seg>
<seg id="22">Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement.</seg>
<seg id="24">We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights.</seg>

<seg id="1">Germany's new warship postponed yet again</seg>
<seg id="2">German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="4">The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="18">Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."</seg>
<seg id="19">The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.</seg>
<seg id="20">He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.</seg>

<seg id="1">When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow.</seg>
<seg id="2">Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters, still hosting an annual "A Christmas Carol."</seg>
<seg id="4">How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. Bogart's iconoclastic hands?</seg>
<seg id="5">She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht's theoretical writings, called "No Plays, No Poetry."</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois-bashing "Summerfolk," Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not.</seg>
<seg id="10">And Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.</seg>
<seg id="12">And "Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky's time and place intact.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty.</seg>
<seg id="16">But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce.</seg>
<seg id="17">The director's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them, but they often literally stand on their heads.</seg>
<seg id="19">Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are moments in this "Summerfolk" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of "Laugh In." "Talk hurts from where it spurts," one of them says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for the humor that Gorky's text provides, when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through Gorky's helpless play.</seg>
<seg id="24">Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio.</seg>
<seg id="25">For Gorky, Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff, which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view.</seg>
<seg id="26">Like Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to "make it new." Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through," surmounting the cliche.</seg>
<seg id="27">The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation, a vision so at odds with the playwright's that the two points of view nullify, rather than illuminate, each other.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms. Bogart's cast is part and parcel of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish, idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna.</seg>
<seg id="30">Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner, not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended.</seg>
<seg id="31">Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse.</seg>
<seg id="32">Janice Duclos, in addition to possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga, everybody's favorite mom.</seg>
<seg id="33">Marni Rice plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her two scenes.</seg>
<seg id="34">But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer, Jonathan Fried (Zamislov, the paralegal) who is the actor to watch, whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor's wife (Becca Lish) by licking her bosom.</seg>

<seg id="7">Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.</seg>
<seg id="8">A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.</seg>
<seg id="10">This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bats are not actually blind.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.</seg>
<seg id="16">They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.</seg>
<seg id="17">The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.</seg>
<seg id="20">Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="24">He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.</seg>
<seg id="27">She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."</seg>

<seg id="1">Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Follow-up Audit Report</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreword</seg>
<seg id="4">Taxes in general constitute the key source of public revenues.</seg>
<seg id="5">It therefore goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (hereinafter “SAIs”) should place focus on that audit area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) fraud is an example.</seg>
<seg id="7">It causes an estimated loss of some EUR 100 billion in the European Union (hereinafter “EU”) each year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already in 2005 during the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn the participants outlined the need for working together very closely.</seg>
<seg id="9">In so doing the SAIs would be able to share audit approaches etc. and find out best practices.</seg>
<seg id="10">VAT is an audit area which is very suitable for tax audit cooperation because it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter “Czech SAI”) and the Federal Court of Auditors - Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “German SAI”) conducted a first ever parallel audit in the field of VAT in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was published in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">As it is known that VAT fraud is a phenomenon not limited to a single country but spread throughout the EU close cooperation amongst the SAIs is needed to ensure comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two SAIs decided therefore to pursue their cooperative efforts in this field and conducted a second parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="15">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="16">Audit number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892</seg>
<seg id="17">Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax (D) Bilateral audit with the NKÚ (follow-up audit)</seg>
<seg id="18">Objective of audit:</seg>
<seg id="19">(CZ) The audit objective was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating VAT and the procedure used to address selected cases of business transactions between the Czech Republic and Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”) and to review the procedures used by the tax administrations of the two countries as part of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="20">(D) On the one hand, the audit was designed to evaluate the steps taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations made by the SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, other fields linked with VAT were to be covered.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resulting audit findings were to be compared and best practices identified (if any).</seg>
<seg id="23">The audit period covered the years 2006 through 2008 including relevant information dating from the time preceding the audit up to the time of audit conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="24">2. Summary of findings and evaluation of parallel audits</seg>
<seg id="25">The follow-up audit of the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.</seg>
<seg id="26">During previous parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some of them merited further review.</seg>
<seg id="28">On the basis of audit findings the two SAIs produced recommendations on VAT management.</seg>
<seg id="29">The follow-up audit was conducted to evaluate the action taken in response to these recommendations and to review the suspicious cases selected.</seg>
<seg id="30">The audit also covered other topics such as the selected cases of high risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance for the recovery of claims and the VAT audit of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="31">When auditing VAT administration in selected areas in the two countries, auditors developed the following audit findings:</seg>
<seg id="32">1. Recommendations from the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="33">• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="34">By comparing the systems of registration for VAT in the two countries auditors found discrepancies in the previous parallel audits.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since the different ways of registration caused problems, the SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="36">This issue was taken up at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="37">The draft of the amended Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No. 218/92 (hereinafter the “Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003”) had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of the VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="38">It also provided for common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The SAIs expected Member States to agree on adequate standards supporting their decision to keep unreliable traders as early as possible out of the VAT system.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the latest version of this document being subject of political agreement among Member States within ECOFIN does no longer cover those issues mentioned before.</seg>
<seg id="41">The two SAIs regret, that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="42">They still consider this idea relevant to combat VAT fraud preventively.</seg>
<seg id="43">• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="44">As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the values of intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="45">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system to combat tax evasion associated with intra-Community transactions has reduced the time limit for submission of recapitulative statements of intra-Community transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective as of 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented as from 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="47">Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting recapitulative statements monthly on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with applicable EU guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="48">• Recommendation 3: Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="49">The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="51">• Recommendation 4: Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level In earlier audit work, the two SAIs concurred that an effective risk management system could not be developed by one Member State only.</seg>
<seg id="52">Good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.</seg>
<seg id="53">If not so, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="54">We found that the two Member States used differing risk management systems that have its strengths and weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="55">In this field, the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU - EUROCANET and the German SAI focused on German participation in the “Platform on Risk Management”.</seg>
<seg id="56">2. Follow-up audit of selected intra-Community transaction cases</seg>
<seg id="57">During the earlier audit, a joint review was performed on business transactions where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="58">The two SAIs selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that included intraCommunity movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">Inspections carried out by the tax offices of the respective countries had not been finished at the conclusion of our previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="60">The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers into/from the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).</seg>
<seg id="61">3. Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="62">We selected high-risk cases of intra-Community transactions made by EU taxpayers presented in EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="63">The EUROCANET system is a tool for the detection of high-risk taxpayers within EU.</seg>
<seg id="64">The Member States can participate in the system on a facultative basis.</seg>
<seg id="65">The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="66">From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States are opposed to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="67">Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained what suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as high-risk cases.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Czech SAI found that cases including normal business transactions were identified during the audit as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and fraudulent activities related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="69">The tax administrators have limited possibilities for inspecting high-risk transactions, concerning in particular “missing traders”, while a physical review of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity to the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="70">The same applies to tax administrators, when import from and export to third countries are additionally combined with intra-Community carousel trading.</seg>
<seg id="71">In these cases, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities aimed at identifying goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitoring their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="72">Germany as well as a number of other countries were reluctant to actively join the EUROCANET system due to the nonexistence of a sufficient legal basis.</seg>
<seg id="73">In Germany, other tools for the detection of risk taxpayers are used that have proven to be suitable for the German tax administration so far.</seg>
<seg id="74">In this area, there is a need for communication and sharing experiences among all EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="75">The EU Council reached political agreement on the draft regulation, which recasts Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="76">Its main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="77">The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="78">4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="79">In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="80">Therefore the handling of requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="81">The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="82">The statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="83">The SAIs considered it useful to discuss again the statistics at EU level with a view on how to avoid the inconsistencies still persisting.</seg>
<seg id="84">Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="85">Moreover, the SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should contain more information concerning VAT.</seg>
<seg id="86">It may be useful for the Commission to provide for an analysis - based on more detailed statistics - to help Member States to enhance effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="87">The two SAIs consider it helpful for Member States with a low rate to increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="88">If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.</seg>
<seg id="89">5. VAT audit of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="90">The SAIs analysed the legal situation concerning the VAT audit of large tax entities in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="91">Additionally, they gathered information from the tax administrations in a questionnaire concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.</seg>
<seg id="92">Based on the replies received, it has become obvious that the situation in the two countries is diverging.</seg>
<seg id="93">The Czech Republic has a system for steering the selection of risk prone cases which is based on a large number of relevant data (i. a. information from conducted VAT audits, data from the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts etc.).</seg>
<seg id="94">This ensures an effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="95">The establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="96">In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist which makes it more difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="97">Germany is still more focused on the selection of respective individual cases especially based on data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="98">The analysis of those data is supported by different risk management components which are going to be enhanced.</seg>
<seg id="99">3. Audit procedure</seg>
<seg id="100">3.1 Audit procedure in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="101">The audit was performed in the period from May 2009 to February 2010 by Division II - Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="102">The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter ”Czech Ministry of Finance”) and 25 tax offices: tax office Brno II, tax office Brno III, tax office Brno IV, tax office in Břeclav, tax office in Domažlice, tax office in Hodonín, tax office in Hradec Králové, tax office in Cheb, tax office in Jablonec nad Nisou, tax office in Karlovy Vary, tax office in Kralupy nad Vltavou, tax office in Kraslice, tax office Ostrava I, tax office Ostrava III, tax office in Písek, tax office in Pilsen, tax office for Prague 1, tax office for Prague 4, tax office for Prague 8, tax office in Rakovník, tax office in Sokolov, tax office in Tábor, tax office in Vysoké Mýto, tax office in Zlín and tax office in Žamberk.</seg>
<seg id="103">The board of the Czech SAI approved the audit conclusions on 27 April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="104">3.2 Audit procedure in Germany</seg>
<seg id="105">The audit was conducted from February 2009 to February 2010 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.</seg>
<seg id="106">After selecting the case examples a number of federal states were notified of the audit mission.</seg>
<seg id="107">Apart from interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the audit took place in the following federal states: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="108">Tax files of the following tax offices were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, Essen für Groß- und Konzernbetriebsprüfung, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd. • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst (Essen-severovýchod), Essen für Groß- und Konzernbetriebsprüfung (Essen - kontrolní úřad pro VDS a koncerny), Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd (Chemnitz-jih).</seg>
<seg id="109">Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Muhlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Sud and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Muenster.</seg>
<seg id="110">The audit findings were reported to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.</seg>
<seg id="111">3.3 Cooperation of the two Supreme Audit Institutions</seg>
<seg id="112">To prepare for the parallel audits, representatives of the two audit institutions met in September 2008, to discuss and determine the audit topics.</seg>
<seg id="113">After that in December 2008, the two SAI heads signed the agreement on cooperation in conducting the parallel audit.</seg>
<seg id="114">At a meeting held in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other on initial results developed during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed upon further action.</seg>
<seg id="115">A second meeting was held in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.</seg>
<seg id="116">The audit teams shared the findings gathered by then and agreed upon the timetable for preparing the joint report.</seg>
<seg id="117">The two SAIs decided to examine the following matters in their parallel audit mission: • follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel audit, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, • audit of the tax administrations' procedure in the field of international assistance for the recovery of VAT claims, • VAT audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="118">The report on the results of the parallel audits was drawn up during the working meeting in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="119">4. Audit of administration of VAT in selected areas</seg>
<seg id="120">4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous audit</seg>
<seg id="121">4.1.1 Evaluation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="122">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="123">Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="124">Based on the the previous audit results, the Czech SAI recommended adjusting the requirements of VAT payer registration and introducing new rules for cancelling the VAT payer registration in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="125">The adjusted requirements should more effectively reduce the risk of potential VAT evasions.</seg>
<seg id="126">In certain cases, it was found out that tax offices failed to apply their authorisation to cancel the VAT registration for the VAT payers who failed to fulfil their obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter „VAT Act“).</seg>
<seg id="127">So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not drafted any amended provisions to introduce an obligation for the tax administrators to cancel the registration for a VAT payer in the event of a repeated failure to submit a VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="128">According to the VAT Act the tax administrator can cancel the registration of a tax payer “ex officio”, if: a) The taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) The taxpayer failed to fulfil his/her obligations pursuant to the VAT Act, c) The taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes.</seg>
<seg id="129">As revealed by the previous audit, the current legislation enabled the tax office for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration as at 31 January of the following calendar year of the “nonresident taxpayers” who incurred no liability during the current calendar year to report and pay tax.</seg>
<seg id="130">The tax office for Prague 1 frequently did not cancel VAT registrations for those taxpayers, since the respective provision did not lay down a sufficient time limit for cancelling the registration.</seg>
<seg id="131">The problem was remedied by the amended VAT Act effective from 1 January 2009.</seg>
<seg id="132">The tax administrator is authorised to cancel the registration of a non-resident tax payer, if he has found out that this tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or tax exempt goods and services with a claim to deduct input VAT in the previous calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="133">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="134">Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="135">As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended introducing monthly submissions of recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="136">The council directive that reduced the period for submissions of recapitulative statements to one month was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which took effect as of 1 January 2010.</seg>
<seg id="137">A new obligation to submit the recapitulative statements in electronic format was developed.</seg>
<seg id="138">Taxpayers have to submit their recapitulative statements also in the event of supplies of services, which are subject to determination of their place of transaction under § 9 (1) of VAT Act, to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, provided that the recipient is obliged to report and pay VAT on those services.</seg>
<seg id="139">The foregoing obligation ensues from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.</seg>
<seg id="140">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="141">Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data This recommendation related to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="142">The Czech administration matches data of intra-Community transactions from VAT returns and recapitulative statements of Czech taxpayers automatically in the system ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="143">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="144">Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level</seg>
<seg id="145">The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for adequate functioning of the EU internal market.</seg>
<seg id="146">Combating VAT fraud is therefore included among the priority interest areas and has been paid considerable attention to in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="147">The importance of this fight has been evidenced inter alia by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to calculate the difference between the due and actually collected VAT amounts in 25 Member States during the period 2000-2006.</seg>
<seg id="148">Based on an analysis of the available data, the evaluator arrived at the conclusion that the estimated loss amount of uncollected VAT for that period totalled from EUR 90 to 113 billion, while EU-25 fails to collect 12 % of due VAT on average each year.</seg>
<seg id="149">The loss incurred on VAT by the Czech Republic in 2006 was estimated even at 18 %.</seg>
<seg id="150">The previous audit noted, as part of international cooperation, that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State only.</seg>
<seg id="151">Successful criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="152">Concerning the risk management system the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU -EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="153">Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers from EU presented in EUROCANET were selected for the audit (see chapter 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="154">The objectives of improved administrative cooperation and enhanced effectiveness of combating VAT fraud should be achieved also through establishing the EUROFISC network, meant to assist improving cooperation of the responsible authorities to a level enabling disclosure of fraud already at an early stage.</seg>
<seg id="155">Later on, the network should become a resource for assessing risk exposures in intra-Community transactions.</seg>
<seg id="156">ECOFIN approved establishment of the EUROFISC network already on 7 October 20089 and stipulated the key principles to govern the network at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="157">A model for EUROFISC can be seen in EUROCANET, the system already operative for the swift and selective exchange of information developed by the Belgian tax authorities in cooperation with the other Member States and with support from the European Commission and OLAF.</seg>
<seg id="158">The objective of the system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="159">4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany</seg>
<seg id="160">The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report resulted in the following findings:</seg>
<seg id="161">Recommendation 1</seg>
<seg id="162">Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU</seg>
<seg id="163">The tax administration in Germany established a well functioning system for the registration of taxpayers that is based on a detailed questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="164">The Federal Ministry of Finance brought this system to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.</seg>
<seg id="165">The system itself is being improved continuously.</seg>
<seg id="166">The data of the questionnaire are now being recorded electronically and will subsequently be available for research so that the data are part of risk management during registration.</seg>
<seg id="167">The Commission made a proposal to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This proposal included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="168">The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.</seg>
<seg id="169">The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany will not go below the standards achieved.</seg>
<seg id="170">Recommendation 2</seg>
<seg id="171">Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="172">On April 8, 2010 a law was adopted for the implementation of EU directives into national law.</seg>
<seg id="173">The law includes provisions regarding the monthly submission of recapitulative statements for intra-Community supplies.</seg>
<seg id="174">The provisions take effect as of 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="175">Recommendation 3</seg>
<seg id="176">Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="177">A joint working group with staff from the federal states and the Federal Ministry of Finance had been established.</seg>
<seg id="178">The group elaborated a strategy for the automatic matching of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="179">The strategy is still under discussion with the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="180">Additionally, this working group also dealt with a tool to optimise the control procedure for the internal market transactions.</seg>
<seg id="181">Recommendation 4</seg>
<seg id="182">Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="183">Germany takes part in this exchange at “Platform on Risk Management”.</seg>
<seg id="184">The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of the platform on risk management was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.</seg>
<seg id="185">The members of the platform split into sub-groups which dealt with topics such as: • Risk tools, • Influencing behaviour, • Evaluation, • Updating the risk management guide.</seg>
<seg id="186">New reports of the sub-groups were published at the beginning of 2010.</seg>
<seg id="187">4.1.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="188">Registration</seg>
<seg id="189">The issue of requirements for registering and cancelling a VAT registration in different countries was addressed at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="190">The draft of the amended Council Regulation No. 1798/2003 had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of VAT payers.</seg>
<seg id="191">It also provided for common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="192">The issues of registration and cancellation of registration have been so far left to the national legislations of the EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="193">The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.</seg>
<seg id="194">The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany has not to go below the standards already achieved.</seg>
<seg id="195">On 8 June 2010 the ECOFIN reached political agreement on the above-mentioned draft regulation.</seg>
<seg id="196">The idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="197">Member States have to implement national procedures and only have to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation of these procedures.</seg>
<seg id="198">The SAIs regret that the Commission did not succeed in convincing Member States of the necessity of common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers as they consider this an important element in the preventive fight against VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="199">They therefore would appreciate further efforts of the Commission in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="200">Monthly submission of recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="201">As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the amounts of the intraCommunity transactions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions has reduced the interval for submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community transactions to one month.</seg>
<seg id="203">In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective 1 January 2010. In Germany it was implemented as of 1 July 2010.</seg>
<seg id="204">Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting monthly recapitulative statements on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with the EU directives.</seg>
<seg id="205">Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements</seg>
<seg id="206">The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="207">The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.</seg>
<seg id="208">Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level</seg>
<seg id="209">Germany and the Czech Republic use different risk management system approaches to identify risk-prone traders.</seg>
<seg id="210">The Czech SAI audited the system of information exchange within EU - EUROCANET (see chapter 4. 3).</seg>
<seg id="211">In this field the German SAI focused on German participation in the Platform on Risk Management.</seg>
<seg id="212">4.2 Follow-up audit of selected intraCommunity transaction cases</seg>
<seg id="213">During the previous audit, a joint review of business transactions was performed where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.</seg>
<seg id="214">The two audit institutions selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that include intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the audit of which carried out by the tax offices of respective countries had not been finished at the time of our previous joint audit.</seg>
<seg id="215">1)</seg>
<seg id="216">A Czech taxpayer acquired goods at the value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="217">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return as the German taxpayer had no VAT ID assigned in the said period, only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="218">Based on international administrative cooperation in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States was not required by the German VAT Act to be assigned a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.</seg>
<seg id="219">A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that based on an audit carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared the goods acquisition in the above amount and simultaneously exercised the right to a tax deduction in the same amount in the VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="220">2)</seg>
<seg id="221">A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods worth of EUR 12,561 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="222">The Czech taxpayer stated he did not acquire the goods and he did not declare it in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="223">The German tax administration refused cooperation upon request, invoking Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 as the turnover on the transactions did not exceed the value of EUR 15,000.</seg>
<seg id="224">As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence, he concluded his audit without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.</seg>
<seg id="225">A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator received two pieces of spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, showing that the German taxpayer billed the said goods to Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="226">The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.</seg>
<seg id="227">3)</seg>
<seg id="228">A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired a passenger car worth EUR 48,500 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="229">The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="230">The same taxpayer did not submit any VAT returns as from August 2004. Therefore the tax administrator assessed VAT at CZK 0 for the said quarter.</seg>
<seg id="231">Based on information obtained from Germany under international exchange of information according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the tax administrator called upon the taxpayer in March 2007 to submit an additional VAT return, which the taxpayer however failed to do.</seg>
<seg id="232">A follow-up audit revealed that the tax administrator performed further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007 that showed that the respective passenger car was sold by the taxpayer to a secondhand car dealer in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="233">The Czech tax administrator issued a tax assessment for the taxation period of December 2004 VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and on their resale was additionally assessed in the amount of CZK 295,379.</seg>
<seg id="234">Based on the ruling of a Regional Court, the Czech taxpayer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="235">In the absence of any sizable assets of the tax debtor, the above arrears appear uncollectible.</seg>
<seg id="236">4)</seg>
<seg id="237">A Czech taxpayer allegedly supplied new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany in the total value of EUR 198,167 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and in the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="238">The response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that there have been criminal proceedings for a tax offence pending against the German entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="239">A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that proof was obtained after conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany to the effect that the German taxpayer was involved in fraudulent activities.</seg>
<seg id="240">The intra-Community acquisition of the goods was taxed at EUR 182,424 (for 2004) and EUR 369,690 (for 2005).</seg>
<seg id="241">A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI established that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel trading in new means of transport.</seg>
<seg id="242">Based on information obtained from the German tax administration with regard to a review of the supply of goods, a VAT audit of the Czech tax entity was commenced for the taxation periods of April, May and June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="243">Based on the audit findings and information obtained from international exchange of information, the tax administrator assessed additional VAT of CZK 703,031 for May 2005 and of CZK 726,551 for June 2005.</seg>
<seg id="244">5)</seg>
<seg id="245">Czech taxpayer A allegedly acquired a machine in the total value of EUR 58,000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="246">The foregoing German taxpayer allegedly supplied a machine at the value of EUR 88,027 to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004, while taxpayer B denied the acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="247">A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that taxpayer B acquired the machine from a German company that had an organisational unit established in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="248">Czech taxpayer A did not declare the acquisition of the goods from the German taxpayer in his VAT return.</seg>
<seg id="249">The response by the German tax administrator to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that the German taxpayer did not perform any intra-Community supply of a machine in the value of EUR 58,000 but performed a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="250">A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that, subsequent to a completed tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="251">6)</seg>
<seg id="252">A German taxpayer allegedly supplied goods in the value of EUR 11,600 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="253">The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="254">A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator assessed an additionally submitted VAT return that contained an unauthorised declaration of acquisition of goods from another Member State that included also the acquisition of the goods in the above value.</seg>
<seg id="255">The German SAI found out that the German tax administrator, upon receipt of a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT of EUR 1,600.</seg>
<seg id="256">Further movements of the goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany are subject of a tax audit.</seg>
<seg id="257">The German taxpayer's recapitulative statement has not been corrected as yet as any recapitulative statement adjustments may be carried out only by the taxpayer who has submitted the recapitulative statement.</seg>
<seg id="258">7)</seg>
<seg id="259">The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, inquiring whether or not a Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car in the value of EUR 47,400 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.</seg>
<seg id="260">After conduct of an audit for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the tax liability at CZK 0 for the Czech taxpayer and notified the German tax administrator that he was unable to confirm the car acquisition by the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="261">A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 on grounds of non-compliance with obligations and the Czech tax administrator referred the supporting documents to the Czech Police.</seg>
<seg id="262">A follow-up audit by the German SAI revealed that the German taxpayer moved his registered office and that, based on a performed audit the new competent local tax administrator cancelled the VAT exemption for the supply of the said car to the Czech taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="263">The German taxpayer has not so far corrected the data in his recapitulative statement and he has filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.</seg>
<seg id="264">8)</seg>
<seg id="265">According to the data in the VIES system, a German taxpayer supplied goods in the total value of EUR 33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="266">A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator was investigating the reasons of the differences that occurred with the Czech taxpayer at the acquisition of the goods during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.</seg>
<seg id="267">The Czech taxpayer repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the 1st quarter of 2005.</seg>
<seg id="268">The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the acquired goods of CZK 134,273 during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005 because, according to the Czech tax administrator, business transactions for separate quarters could not be precisely traced and the tax administrator therefore accepted the submitted VAT returns.</seg>
<seg id="269">9)</seg>
<seg id="270">A German taxpayer supplied goods worth EUR 46,854 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="271">For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared an intra-Community acquisition of goods only in the value of EUR 14,856.</seg>
<seg id="272">The Czech tax administrator reviewed the amount of the performed supplies as part of international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="273">Attached to the response to the request for information delivered from Germany were three invoices stating the total value of the goods supply at EUR 31,998, which is an amount corresponding to the difference of the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and VIES system data.</seg>
<seg id="274">A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech taxpayer, following repeated reminders by the tax administrator, submitted an additional VAT return in January 2007 for the taxation period of July 2004.</seg>
<seg id="275">In the said VAT return, the taxpayer at the same time exercised his VAT deduction right and the tax liability for the respective taxation period remained unchanged as a result of that.</seg>
<seg id="276">The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers in Germany and the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).</seg>
<seg id="277">4.3 Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions</seg>
<seg id="278">4.3.1 Audit findings in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="279">EUROCANET can be a major source of information for detecting risky entities within a Member State where the goods were acquired.</seg>
<seg id="280">In the Czech Republic, the early-warning information obtained from the EUROCANET system is compared with the acquirers' data by the competent local tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="281">Since the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending information to the EUROCANET system on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="282">Nine Czech tax entities being part of the EUROCANET were selected for the audit.</seg>
<seg id="283">They acted either as supplier to or as acquirer from the tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="284">Relevant data was captured in the EUROCANET system by the tax administrations of other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="285">Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained with the help of it whether or not suppliers with a German VAT ID have been assessed as risky entities by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="286">The audit revealed cases which included normal business transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities related to VAT.</seg>
<seg id="287">In the respective cases, tax administrators share information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.</seg>
<seg id="288">For example:</seg>
<seg id="289">• The tax administrators did not detect any suspected involvement in risky transactions during the verification of the early-warning information.</seg>
<seg id="290">Tax offices continuously monitor the tax entity for the reason of being involved in the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="291">• The tax offices did not succeed in proving deviations from the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT from the presented accounting records during the verification of risky transaction, even though tax offices found out discrepancies in transportation and warehousing of goods or detected business relationships with suspicious and non-contactable companies from the other Member States.</seg>
<seg id="292">• The verification of business transactions was complicated, because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax administrator and could not be contacted.</seg>
<seg id="293">Competent local tax offices mostly reviewed the risky tax entities and risky transactions set out in early-warning information from the EUROCANET system.</seg>
<seg id="294">The tax administrators have only limited possibilities to review risky transactions concerning particularly those of so-called “missing traders”, because an inspection of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="295">Stricter requirements for registering taxpayers for VAT and more flexible cancellations of the registration would assist in reducing missing trader fraud.</seg>
<seg id="296">On behalf of the tax entities involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities, registrations for VAT are made for the purpose of reporting EU-wide fictitious supplies of goods or issuing formally accurate tax documents to the taxpayers who then make unauthorised deductions of input VAT.</seg>
<seg id="297">In case of suspicion that tax entities are involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities in connection with imports from and exports to third countries, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="298">This would help to identify goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitor their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.</seg>
<seg id="299">The Member States can participate in the system on an optional basis.</seg>
<seg id="300">The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of the EUROCANET system was considered as a weakness of the system by the European Parliament at the end of 200814, which should be remedied by establishing a compulsory EUROFISC network.</seg>
<seg id="301">4.3.2 Audit findings in Germany</seg>
<seg id="302">The German SAI analysed data available in the Federal Central Tax Office with EUROCANET data included.</seg>
<seg id="303">These data served as basis to select six German taxpayers' files for review.</seg>
<seg id="304">Germany as well as some other countries refused to actively join EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="305">Therefore, Germany has a passive status which means that it does not send data to Brussels but is only a recipient of EUROCANET data.</seg>
<seg id="306">The justification for doing so is that “in the view of the government it is legally not allowed that state (governmental) institutions submit data to EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="307">Currently there is no legal basis in place that would permit to break applicable tax secrecy provisions.</seg>
<seg id="308">Additionally, the government has no reliable information on how those data are used within EUROCANET by the other Member States.”15 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has analysed the EUROCANET data and has submitted them to the tax authorities of the federal states according to a procedure agreed between them.</seg>
<seg id="309">The German tax offices receive control information about the direct business relations of a taxpayer registered in the specific tax office with a trader from another EU Member State which was entered into EUROCANET.</seg>
<seg id="310">However, the German tax office does not receive any information on whether the trader of the aforementioned other EU Member State had risky business relations with traders in other Member States which also did business with the respective German trader.</seg>
<seg id="311">4.3.3 Evaluation</seg>
<seg id="312">The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.</seg>
<seg id="313">From the point of view of an active participant it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to become an active member.</seg>
<seg id="314">Consequently, the audit in this field had to be conducted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="315">Nevertheless, the results did not reveal great differences with regard to detecting VAT fraud cases. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one tool in a risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="316">The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="317">The Council of the EU reached political agreement on a draft regulation whose main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.</seg>
<seg id="318">The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="319">Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.</seg>
<seg id="320">On the other hand, the cases brought before courts of law nationally and at European level revealed that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission about the conditions for the tax exemption of intra-Community transactions seems to be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="321">4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims</seg>
<seg id="322">4.4.1 International assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="323">The core legislation on international cooperation in recovery of certain financial claims within the EU comprises the following directives without limitation:</seg>
<seg id="324">• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and custom duties;</seg>
<seg id="325">• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value added tax and certain excise duties;</seg>
<seg id="326">• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.</seg>
<seg id="327">Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented in the Czech Republic by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">Following adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, the Directive had to be implemented into the Czech system of law and the foregoing act had to be amended at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="329">New Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims (hereinafter “Act No. 191/2004 Coll.”), was adopted in this connection.</seg>
<seg id="330">A new relevant legal provision has recently been put into place by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="331">Annexes to the Regulation set out new models of the application forms in use as from 1 January 2009, and the Regulation newly stipulated the obligation of electronic communication and obligation of the applicant authority to certify the conformity of any sent documents with their originals.</seg>
<seg id="332">Key principles of providing international cooperation in recovery of claims are:</seg>
<seg id="333">1. reciprocita (vzájemnost);</seg>
<seg id="334">2. assistance is always provided only upon request and where all requirements are fulfilled;</seg>
<seg id="335">3. assistance shall not include any financial claims that are described as a sanction of a criminal nature in the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="336">4. the procedure at providing international assistance for the recovery of claims must abide by the national laws of the requested state;</seg>
<seg id="337">5. foreign claims shall have no priority over domestic claims in the recovery process;</seg>
<seg id="338">6. assistance is provided only to recover indisputable claims;</seg>
<seg id="339">7. exhaustion principle: the applicant state has exhausted all available means of recovery of the claim enabled by its system of law.</seg>
<seg id="340">Act No. 191/2004 Coll., specifies three forms of giving assistance: provision of information; delivery of instruments; and recovery of claims in particular.</seg>
<seg id="341">Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="342">A competent local tax office shall electronically transfer the request for information, request for notification or request for recovery of claims together with respective documents, to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the financial directorates.</seg>
<seg id="343">The Czech Ministry of Finance shall provide for translating the request into the respective language, shall scan it including its attachments and, through the CCN/CSI network, and shall send it to the respective tax administration authority of the specified state.</seg>
<seg id="344">Two basic requirements have been imposed with respect to the recovery - the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500 and shall not be older than 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="345">The requested authority may refuse the claim recovery, if the requirements have not been met.</seg>
<seg id="346">Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="347">Where requests from another Member State are received, the Czech Ministry of Finance must forthwith acknowledge receipt of the request as soon as possible upon receiving it, however within seven days at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="348">If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides it is not going to admit the request, it shall notify the applicant authority of the reasons for rejecting the request and shall set out concrete provisions of the Directive which it relies on.</seg>
<seg id="349">Such notification should be sent no later than within three months of the date of acknowledgement of the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="350">Upon receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall verify if the request meets all legal requirements. After that, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall transfer the request through a financial directorate to the competent local tax office for processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">In the event the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator shall i. a. identify the debtor's assets, e. g. through the extracts from the Cadastre of Real Estate, identification of bank accounts, registrations of motor vehicles with the Traffic Inspectorate etc.</seg>
<seg id="352">When six months have elapsed from the date of the request receipt acknowledgement, the Czech Ministry of Finance should notify the applicant authority of the outcome of the investigation that has been undertaken in order to obtain the requested information.</seg>
<seg id="353">The applicant authority should also be informed in the event that the tax entities in question cannot be contacted and the claim can therefore not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="354">Any amount successfully recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the applicant authority within one month from the date on which such claim was recovered.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Czech tax administrator making efforts to recover foreign claims may use an option to allow a moratorium on the payment of the claim or its payment by instalments, providing the applicant state gives its consent to that.</seg>
<seg id="356">The interest or penalty charge is assessed to the debtor for the recovery period in accordance with Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="357">Such interest or penal charges shall pertain to the state that has requested the recovery.</seg>
<seg id="358">Concerning received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit the requests to the competent tax administrators in time, particularly during 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="359">A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="360">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act on the international assistance for the recovery of claims because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress made with the recovery within the six months time period from the day when the receipt of the request was acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="361">The situation has improved since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="362">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="363">The Czech Ministry of Finance prepares statistical data for the European Commission in accordance with § 13 (4) of Act No. 191/2004 Coll., by 15 March each year, setting out the number of information, notification and recovery requests sent and/or received in the previous year, the amount of the claims involved and the amounts recovered according to the year of request to which they relate.</seg>
<seg id="364">Based on the supporting data provided by all Member States, the European Commission reports the Council and the European Parliament on the use of the provisions on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.</seg>
<seg id="365">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance understated its statistical data by EUR 5,250,000 due to an error in the item of claims recovered in 2008, as a result of an incorrectly stated amount of the VAT claim subject to recovery (the error consisted in a shifted decimal marker when translating the CZK amount of the claims into its EUR equivalent).</seg>
<seg id="366">The error subsequently was reflected in the European Commission statistics.</seg>
<seg id="367">Information on the mutual assistance with recoveries is set out in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="368">4.4.2 International assistance for the recovery of claims in Germany</seg>
<seg id="369">The legal authority for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).</seg>
<seg id="370">For the sake of better readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197619, whose provisions have been amended substantially several times.</seg>
<seg id="371">The provisions apply i. a. to the recovery of VAT and of taxes on income and capital including the related interest charges and penalties.</seg>
<seg id="372">The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into domestic German law by the Collection of State Taxes (EC) Act of 3 May 2003.</seg>
<seg id="373">The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.</seg>
<seg id="374">Article 117.2 of the Code points out, that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal instruments of the European Communities that are applicable within the national jurisdiction and of the EC Administrative Assistance Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Part six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346), embodies the legal provisions governing enforcement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="376">The administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed especially by the Execution Instruction and the Enforcement Instruction.</seg>
<seg id="377">The Federal Ministry of Finance reached agreement with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the federal states (Laender) on the principles of administrative assistance with tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="378">General preconditions for submitting requests for recovery are:</seg>
<seg id="379">• Legal prerequisites have to be fulfilled (§§ 251, 254 German Fiscal Code (AO)).</seg>
<seg id="380">• All available domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="381">• The claims for which recovery assistance is requested have to be definitive.</seg>
<seg id="382">• The period between the issuing of the enforcement order or the date when the claim becomes final (is no longer subject to appeal) and the date of the request may not exceed 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="383">• The total amount of the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500.</seg>
<seg id="384">Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="385">German requests for recovery of delinquent tax liabilities are sent from the execution units of the tax offices to the relevant foreign authority as for instance the Czech CLO via the intermediate authority and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="386">Details are governed by the Guidance on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery) of 19 January 2004.23 This Guidance is currently being revised by a Federal Government/Laender working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.</seg>
<seg id="387">The request together with the attachments is submitted electronically by the tax office to the intermediate authority.</seg>
<seg id="388">This authority checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.</seg>
<seg id="389">If not, the request is returned to the respective tax office.</seg>
<seg id="390">Otherwise the request is submitted to the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="391">The Federal Central Tax Office will then provide for the necessary communication with the respective foreign authority, including the translation of the request.</seg>
<seg id="392">Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States</seg>
<seg id="393">Requests for recovery received from other Member States are being registered in the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt is sent out within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="394">Additionally, the Federal Central Tax Office checks whether the formal requirements are met.</seg>
<seg id="395">In principle the Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediate authority, which in turn submits them to the respective tax office and monitors execution.</seg>
<seg id="396">The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and/or final reports.</seg>
<seg id="397">If the handling of a request takes more than 6 months, it will remind the intermediate authority of the interim report that is required according to the article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EG.</seg>
<seg id="398">After having checked the formal and factual preconditions of a request, the execution units announce enforcement measures.</seg>
<seg id="399">Any amount recovered has to be transferred to the bank account given in the request within one month after receipt.</seg>
<seg id="400">Statistical data</seg>
<seg id="401">Information on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic for 2006-2008 (as of 31 December 2008).</seg>
<seg id="402">4.4.3 Audit of recovery requests, case studies</seg>
<seg id="403">A total of 21 requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for the audit as part of international cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="404">A review of ten selected cases revealed, without limitation:</seg>
<seg id="405">1.</seg>
<seg id="406">On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of a claim to VAT for the years 2004 and 2005, totalling EUR 3,883 = CZK 109,820, concerning a Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="407">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the tax administrator as late as on 26 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="408">In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech tax administrator established a security interest in real estate owned by the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="409">Since the pledged property alone was not sufficient to satisfy the total claim to be recovered, payment by instalments of at least CZK 2,000 monthly was agreed with the Czech tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="410">On 31 August 2009, information on the claim recovery progress was sent to the German tax administration, noting that the claim was partly recovered in the amount of CZK 49,600 through the instalments as of 25 August 2009.</seg>
<seg id="411">The said amount was remitted to Germany and, on 28 August 2008, another instalment of CZK 3,000 was sent to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="412">2.</seg>
<seg id="413">On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 180,869 = CZK 4,434,915 of VAT, income tax and interest and fees.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administrator as late as on 27 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="415">The tax administrator, based on a review of ownership of bank accounts, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable assets established that the debtor owned no distrainable assets.</seg>
<seg id="416">An investigation on site further revealed that the debtor had not been present at his permanent domicile address for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="417">His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="418">This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009, while the tax administrator sent its response to the German tax administration on 16 April 2009.</seg>
<seg id="419">3.</seg>
<seg id="420">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany on 21 November 2007, concerning the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity totalling EUR 3,139 = CZK 84,846 in VAT plus interest and fees.</seg>
<seg id="421">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the recovery request as late as on 6 August 2008, although the Czech Ministry of Finance meanwhile received a notification from Germany on 18 February 2008 that the Czech tax entity already had settled the claim in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="422">On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that this recovery case had been closed because the claim had been paid by the Czech tax entity in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="423">The said claim, however, was paid also in the Czech Republic under the recovery process and credited to Germany on 27 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="424">Given the long time taken by the Czech Ministry of Finance to inform the authorised tax administrator, the claim was paid twice - by the entity itself in Germany and once again through the claim recovery by the Czech tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="425">In cooperation with the German SAI, it was ascertained that the recovered amount will be offset against a claim under another recovery request totalling EUR 6,649 and intended for sending to the Czech Republic in September 2008.</seg>
<seg id="426">With respect to the company in question, the Czech Ministry of Finance records show only a request for claim recovery at EUR 3,139 while the request for recovering the claim of EUR 6,649 was not in the Czech Ministry of Finance records.</seg>
<seg id="427">4.</seg>
<seg id="428">On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 39,957 = CZK 956,654 of income tax and VAT, interest and fees.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the Czech tax administrator on 19 December 2008.</seg>
<seg id="430">On 1 June 2009, a procedure for claim recovery was started; an order for the distraint of the bank accounts in the Czech Republic and for the attachment of wages in the amount of CZK 7,000 was issued.</seg>
<seg id="431">During the negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he disagreed with the amount of the claim and considered it disputable.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to the Czech tax administrator, the tax entity was previously willing to pay EUR 250 monthly, which was, however, not accepted by the German tax administrator.</seg>
<seg id="433">The tax entity promised to discuss its application with the German tax administrator, with an aim to reach a changed amount of the claim.</seg>
<seg id="434">The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.</seg>
<seg id="435">5.</seg>
<seg id="436">On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity owing the total of EUR 113,444 = CZK 3,116,304 of income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003-2007, interest and fees.</seg>
<seg id="437">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to tax office for Prague 1, which is authorised to administer taxes of the non-resident tax entities in the Czech Republic, as late as on 14 November 2008, since the competent local tax administrator could not be determined based on the available address of the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="438">The tax office obtained information during the performed investigation that the debtor has an income of EUR 4,704 on 19 September 2008, for which the tax office has been however unable to issue an execution order as the request for the claim recovery was transferred to the tax office after that date.</seg>
<seg id="439">On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator commenced the claim recovery process and issued an execution order to secure the claim against the debtor's cash held in the accounts kept with banks and credit unions.</seg>
<seg id="440">The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.</seg>
<seg id="441">6.</seg>
<seg id="442">On 3 October 2006, the Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation for the recovery of a claim for VAT and cost of proceedings, totalling CZK 146,223,742.</seg>
<seg id="443">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the German tax administration as late as on 13 May 2008.</seg>
<seg id="444">On 8 September 2008, the German tax administrator transferred the amount obtained through the seizure of the funds on the debtor's account at the amount of EUR 17,700 = CZK 439,226 through Bundesbank to the Czech authorities.</seg>
<seg id="445">On reviewing the amounts of the recovered claims, an error in translation of the amount subject to recovery was identified.</seg>
<seg id="446">The recovered amount of CZK 146,223,742 was translated at the rate EUR 1 = CZK 25.065, however with an error resulting in an amount of EUR 583,378.</seg>
<seg id="447">The correct translation of the amount subject to recovery is EUR 5,833,782.</seg>
<seg id="448">The request for recovery sent to Germany was lower by EUR 5,250,404 as a result of that.</seg>
<seg id="449">7.</seg>
<seg id="450">On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance for the recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing the total of CZK 1,970,632 = EUR 79,847 of VAT, interest and charges.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administration in Germany as late as on 10 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="452">On 4 February 2009, the German tax administrator called upon the debtor to pay the arrears.</seg>
<seg id="453">In view of considerable drops in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 in particular and given the related liquidity situation of the company, the following payments were made to repay the arrears: on 8 April 2009 -EUR 4,600; on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3,000; and, on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2,500.</seg>
<seg id="454">The payments were credited to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="455">On 23 June 2009, the German tax administrator reached an agreement with the debtor that the latter would pay another instalment of EUR 2,500 by 30 June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="456">8.</seg>
<seg id="457">A request for recovery of the claim totalling EUR 398,653 = CZK 9,832,779 and including also a claim for property transfer tax was delivered by the Czech tax administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.</seg>
<seg id="458">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="459">On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the request was returned by the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="460">The German tax administration justified the return by explaining that the property transfer tax did not constitute a tax as per Art. 2(e)(f)(g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.</seg>
<seg id="461">The German tax administration further added that Art. 2(g) applied to the claims relating to income tax and taxes on assets.</seg>
<seg id="462">Accordingly, Art. 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and asset taxes not listed in Art. 1(3) in combination with paragraph (4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.</seg>
<seg id="463">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to prepare and submit a new recovery request excluding the property transfer tax arrears at the amount of CZK 61,759, while setting out the arrears for VAT, corporate income tax and individual income tax, and to resend the request to the German tax administration.</seg>
<seg id="464">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of the tax arrears relating to the same tax entity which owed the amount of CZK 7,079,735 of the liable income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="465">9.</seg>
<seg id="466">On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a recovery request to the Czech Ministry of Finance with respect to the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing the total of CZK 3,445,782 = EUR 123,328 of individual income tax and VAT.</seg>
<seg id="467">The aggregate amount of VAT was CZK 1,133,967.</seg>
<seg id="468">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administration in Germany as late as on 18 April 2007.</seg>
<seg id="469">The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded a response by the German tax administration of 9 July 2007 to the Czech tax administrator as late as on 11 November 2008.</seg>
<seg id="470">The response stated that the German tax administrator issued an execution order for the bank account with a bank on 11 June 2007, however was advised by the bank the debtor had no business relationship with the tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="471">As a result, the German tax administration considered the case closed.</seg>
<seg id="472">10.</seg>
<seg id="473">On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax administrator dispatched a request for recovery to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning VAT arrears totalling CZK 1,296,845 = EUR 43,591.</seg>
<seg id="474">The request by the Czech tax administrator was delivered to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.</seg>
<seg id="475">The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the German tax administration on 15 December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="476">Prior to dispatching the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator distrained funds of the debtor in a bank account, obtained an attachment of wages and established a security interest in real property.</seg>
<seg id="477">The recovery request was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax administrator on 16 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="478">According to the response to the request for information received by the Czech tax administrator on 16 September 2005, the Czech tax entity was resident in Germany and had an income of EUR 8,437 from a non-business activity.</seg>
<seg id="479">The Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the request for recovery on 20 April 2006 and passed it on to the Czech tax administrator as late as on 12 February 2008.</seg>
<seg id="480">The response stated that no recovery proceedings could be instituted in Germany due to the debtor's insolvency, that no assets of the debtor were identified and that his income from non-business activities had been already a subject of other execution proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="481">As a result, the German tax administration deemed the request for recovery complied with.</seg>
<seg id="482">4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="483">In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="484">The procedures for handling requests for international assistance with the recovery of claims are similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="485">The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="486">The statistics contained inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="487">In its report of 2006, the European Commission recommended that the Member States needed to take greater care in establishing their statistics.</seg>
<seg id="488">In its report from 2009 the Commission concluded that the discrepancies in the statistics had decreased although the number of requests had increased.</seg>
<seg id="489">The two SAIs considered it useful to discuss the matter of statistics again at EU level.</seg>
<seg id="490">Discussion should focus on how to avoid the inconsistencies that still persist. Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.</seg>
<seg id="491">Moreover the two SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should disclose the annual number of requests as well as the nature of claims concerned (VAT, income tax etc.) and amounts of the claims recovered per Member State.</seg>
<seg id="492">The two SAIs consider it useful that the Commission provides for a more detailed analysis of the statistics submitted by the Member States, because this may help the Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.</seg>
<seg id="493">As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the two SAIs consider it helpful that Member States with a low rate should increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="494">If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.</seg>
<seg id="495">Concerning the requests for recovery received, the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted the requests to the competent tax administrators with delay in particular during 2006 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="496">A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="497">The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act No. 191/2004 Coll. for the international assistance for the recovery of claims, because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress of the recovery efforts within the six months time period from the day of acknowledgement of receiving the request.</seg>

<seg id="499">4.5.1 VAT audit of large tax entities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="500">Všeobecné informace</seg>
<seg id="501">Správa DPH u VDS byla zajišťována obdobně jako u ostatních daňových subjektů.</seg>
<seg id="502">The procedure for the large tax entity audit is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.</seg>
<seg id="503">The Czech Ministry of Finance defined large tax entities as natural or legal persons founded or established for the purpose of doing business and whose net turnover for the taxation period declared in their individual or corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 bn and more.</seg>
<seg id="504">Classification of a tax entity as large tax entity was carried out following its income tax return submission for the respective taxation period, and for 2003 for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="505">The tax entity ceased to be classified as an large tax entity in the event that its net turnover for the taxation period dropped below the above mentioned limit during three successive taxation periods counted from the end of the period for which the entity submitted its tax return based on which it was then classified under large tax entity.</seg>
<seg id="506">No tax entity could be removed from the large tax entities' records without a tax audit of at least one tax type for at least one period being performed before.</seg>
<seg id="507">All large tax entities were audited at least every five years until the end of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="508">Since 2010, a written evaluation of the tax entity needs to be performed at least once every 2 years, while the selected follow-up procedure has to eliminate tax risks and their negative implications for the accurate assessment and collection of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="509">The audits shall focus on at least one tax type, while, as a rule, the tax administrator selects several tax periods for a single exercise.</seg>
<seg id="510">The large tax entities were audited by staff of the specialised audit departments - established at 13 tax offices in total -or audit departments of the competent local tax offices.</seg>
<seg id="511">A specialised audit department carries out tax audits within its local competence area as determined by the director of the financial directorate.</seg>
<seg id="512">Kromě kontroly VDS kontroluje též:</seg>
<seg id="513">• tax entities engaged in uncommon and specific business fields,</seg>
<seg id="514">• entities whose tax audits involve special expertise and time demands,</seg>
<seg id="515">• entities with an intricate territorial and organisational structure,</seg>
<seg id="516">• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasions,</seg>
<seg id="517">• entities that are members of chains and networks, where suspicions exist of large-scale tax evasions and of unjustifiable excessive deductions.</seg>
<seg id="518">The number of tax audits performed by the specialised audit departments of tax offices and their results are set out in Table No. 3.</seg>
<seg id="519">The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to amend the Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial authorities, specifically by establishing a specialised tax office with the nation-wide competence for the selected tax entities (i. a. for legal persons incorporated for the purpose of doing business and having a turnover of more than CZK 2 bn).</seg>
<seg id="520">4.5.2 VAT audit of large tax entities in Germany</seg>
<seg id="521">Obecné informace</seg>
<seg id="522">VAT audits of large companies are governed by the same rules as tax audits in general, i. e. the relevant provisions are laid down in • the German Fiscal Code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), and • tax audit regulations (BpO).</seg>
<seg id="523">Additional documents for guidance are in place.</seg>
<seg id="524">German Fiscal Code</seg>
<seg id="525">The legal provisions provided for in articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in “Section IV - tax field audit”: in particular, these articles embody the rules for the admissibility of a tax field audit (audit on the premises of an enterprise), its scope as to subject matter, rules on allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of audit notification, audit principles, the taxable person's duties to cooperate and the prerequisites for holding final discussions and communicating the audit report.</seg>
<seg id="526">Tax field audits are carried out by the responsible tax offices (Article 195 of the Code).</seg>
<seg id="527">Fiscal Administrative Act According to Article 5.1 item 1 in connection with Art. 19 of the Act, the participation in tax field audits carried out by tax offices is incumbent on the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="528">The nature and scope of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax field audits are agreed between the authorities involved.</seg>
<seg id="529">Moreover the Federal Central Tax Office is entitled to demand that specific enterprises it has named are audited at a time it has specified.</seg>
<seg id="530">In this case it may promulgate rules for the conduct and contents of audits on the premises of these companies.</seg>
<seg id="531">Tax Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the Tax Audit Regulations (German abbreviation: BpO 2000) were promulgated with the consent of the Bundesrat (the upper chamber of the German Parliament on which the Lander governments are represented).</seg>
<seg id="532">The administrative regulations applied to tax field work of Lander tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.</seg>
<seg id="533">Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals pursuant to Article 3 of the Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="534">Large enterprises are to be subjected to a follow-up audit (Article 4.2 of the Regulations).</seg>
<seg id="535">Article 33.1 of the Regulations, each cognisant tax authority has to keep a register of groups of companies being also defined in the Regulations.</seg>
<seg id="536">Administrative guidance</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the following documents provide additional guidance for the tax administration:</seg>
<seg id="538">• Uniform Manual for special VAT audits in Germany;</seg>
<seg id="539">• USLO Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the data on intra-Community business relations held on VIES;</seg>
<seg id="540">• working aids for different and special subjects.</seg>
<seg id="541">• ZAUBER Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the database ZAUBER;</seg>
<seg id="542">The classification of tax entities is based on criteria like turnover and net income with different thresholds according to the line of business.</seg>
<seg id="543">The figures are made public by the Federal Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="544">They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.</seg>
<seg id="545">The number of businesses - not only large businesses - has to be ascertained at regular audit intervals (latest interval: 1st January 2010).</seg>
<seg id="546">In general, large businesses have to be audited continuously.</seg>
<seg id="547">The audits are generally announced including VAT.</seg>
<seg id="548">That means: during the audit timeframe especially income tax or corporation tax, trade tax, and VAT - all kinds of relevant taxes - have to be audited finally.</seg>
<seg id="549">VAT audits can be carried either by tax auditors or by VAT auditors.</seg>
<seg id="550">This varies and depends on the organisational structure in the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="551">The number of taxation periods covered by an audit varies regularly between 3 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="552">The BpO 2000 assumes an audit period of 3 years.</seg>
<seg id="553">All taxes a company was assessed for are subject to review.</seg>
<seg id="554">4.5.3 Management of audits of large tax entities</seg>
<seg id="555">As both SAIs decided not to review individual cases they focused on management questions to get a picture on how the tax administrations handle the issue of VAT audits of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="556">Based on a questionnaire, they gathered information from the tax administrations concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.</seg>
<seg id="557">• What statistical records and analyses concerning the VAT audit of large businesses are available to the management of the tax administration?</seg>
<seg id="558">In particular:</seg>
<seg id="559">• Are there any statistics or records about the extent to which a distinction is drawn between fighting VAT fraud and general VAT inspection?</seg>
<seg id="560">The Czech Republic: No, system ATIS in current data version does not allow drawing this difference.</seg>
<seg id="561">Germany: The tax administration does not differentiate between an audit designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT inspection.</seg>
<seg id="562">• Are there any statistics or records about the timeliness of VAT audits (in relation to the time of the transactions audited)?</seg>
<seg id="563">The Czech Republic: Records about the timeliness of enquiries relevant to intra-Community acquisition of goods of selected VAT taxpayers are shown in system ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="564">Additionally, such information as how long did the enquiries take is also part of the data recorded in ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="565">Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors only contain information on the average last audit period (year).</seg>
<seg id="566">This is a figure that does not provide an overview of the selected audit periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="567">VAT auditors focus on the latest VAT assessment periods and are also entitled to audit large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="568">But the statistics on federal level for special VAT auditors does not provide information concerning the classification of tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="569">• Are there any statistics or records about the nature of the additionally generated VAT revenues; divided e.g. according to the following features:</seg>
<seg id="570">i. genuine increase in tax liability (e. g. application of a reduced tax rate instead of the standard VAT rate)</seg>
<seg id="571">ii. only nominal increase in tax liability (e. g. shift of a full-compliance VAT case to a different taxable period)</seg>
<seg id="572">iii. additional tax revenue collected (payment of the outstanding additional tax due)</seg>
<seg id="573">The Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="574">The Czech tax administration monitors the numbers of tax verifications performed, levels of additional tax assessment broken down by types of tax, by the number of audited tax subjects and by the number of controlled taxable periods.</seg>
<seg id="575">Other tax procedures (local investigation, reproach procedure) are monitored in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="576">As an independent task, data and the amount of additionally paid taxes are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="577">Statistics of general debts broken down by types of tax but not according to declared tax or tax found out by a tax administrator are also kept.</seg>
<seg id="578">Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not distinguish between the above mentioned criteria.</seg>
<seg id="579">Moreover most of the tax administrations visited do not make such a distinction either.</seg>
<seg id="580">• Are audit fields that yield high additional revenues recorded?</seg>
<seg id="581">The Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator is in a position to select taxpayers for verification on the basis of criteria which can be linked with chosen indicators in special parts of ATIS.</seg>
<seg id="582">Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).</seg>
<seg id="583">Subsequently the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="584">But there is one coordinated approach of the ministries of finance of the “Lander” and the “Bund”.</seg>
<seg id="585">In the ZAUBER data base, tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability if it exceeds a certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this case, they have to specify e. g. the nature of the assessed increase in VAT liability.</seg>
<seg id="587">• What are the most frequent findings?</seg>
<seg id="588">The Czech Republic:</seg>
<seg id="589">- large tax entities exercised an unauthorised right to deduct input VAT for supplies and services,</seg>
<seg id="590">• that were not used to perform any economic activity as per § 72 (1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="591">• that were used for any entertainment purposes as per § 75 (3) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="592">• based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements as laid down in § 73 (1) of the VAT Act;</seg>
<seg id="593">- large tax entities did not declare output VAT as per § 21 (1) of the VAT Act.</seg>
<seg id="594">Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).</seg>
<seg id="595">Subsequently the unified statistics at federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.</seg>
<seg id="596">Findings in respect to VAT are not separately recorded by the federal states (Lander) as far as they result from tax audits of large companies.</seg>
<seg id="597">But in the ZAUBER database in which tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability exceeding a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse such information.</seg>
<seg id="598">• Does the tax administration analyse audit fields that produce a high ‘yield' and does it draw the consequences for the management?</seg>
<seg id="599">The Czech Republic: Yes, for example they launch national audit proceedings aimed at risky commodities or a subject of economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="600">Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).</seg>
<seg id="601">The unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide information about audit fields that produce a high ‘yield'.</seg>
<seg id="602">There are diverse opinions on the process of analysing as well as of managing cases under the aspect of materiality.</seg>
<seg id="603">Some regional tax offices provide special information; but the tax offices are free to make use of them.</seg>
<seg id="604">4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation</seg>
<seg id="605">The different answers of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of information including information about conducted VAT audits as well as data of the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts.</seg>
<seg id="606">On the basis of a wide range of information the Czech Republic is able to steer the selection of risk prone cases.</seg>
<seg id="607">The same applies to analysis and management of VAT control in general.</seg>
<seg id="608">In the Czech Republic the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="609">In Germany, the tax administration does not collect such information.</seg>
<seg id="610">Subsequently it is more difficult to fulfil these tasks in a similar way.</seg>
<seg id="611">But nevertheless Germany's philosophy places more focus on selecting respective individual cases based on VAT return information submitted.</seg>
<seg id="612">Therefore risk management components are going to be enhanced and improved.</seg>
<seg id="613">On the basis of adequate reference notes, well trained tax auditors have to assess the accurate amount of VAT.</seg>
<seg id="614">The two SAIs are of the opinion that Member States should be able to provide adequate management as well as an adequate risk management system.</seg>
<seg id="615">This will help reduce VAT shortfalls.</seg>
<seg id="616">As a result, VAT revenue as well as the risk for unreliable entrepreneurs to be detected will increase.</seg>
<seg id="617">5. Conclusions</seg>
<seg id="618">The cooperation of the two SAIs within the parallel audits of the administration of VAT achieved the objectives set by the German and Czech SAI.</seg>
<seg id="619">The two SAIs developed a deeper understanding of the applicable systems in the Czech Republic and Germany in the fields of: • intra-Community transactions, • risk management of VAT, especially concerning the selection of risk prone transactions, • recovery of VAT claims, and • VAT audits of large tax entities.</seg>
<seg id="620">Due to mutual cooperation, differences of strategies to detect VAT fraud cases and in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.</seg>
<seg id="621">Audit findings were compared and on their basis best practices were identified.</seg>
<seg id="622">Furthermore, the SAIs hope that the results achieved may encourage stakeholders to enter into discussions about approaches and strategies within and among Member States as well as with the EU Commission.</seg>
<seg id="623">The invaluable experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of the two SAIs may serve as an encouragement to conduct future audit missions of VAT administration.</seg>
<seg id="624">6. Communique</seg>
<seg id="625">The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the two Presidents of the Czech and German SAI.</seg>
<seg id="626">Editorial deadline: June 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels, or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yet under Mr. Reagan's preferred successor, President Bush, those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine.</seg>
<seg id="3">And, surprisingly, little more than a whimper of protest is being heard, even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The programs have arthritis," says Rep. Henry Hyde, a conservative Republican from Illinois.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet, he asserts, "you look around . . . and you say, `Who are the leaders?</seg>
<seg id="6">Who is going to carry the water? '"</seg>
<seg id="7">It isn't surprising that President Bush hasn't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI. Though he nominally supports both programs, Mr. Bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as Mr. Reagan was.</seg>
<seg id="8">What's surprising is that there isn't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list.</seg>
<seg id="9">A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives, a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility.</seg>
<seg id="10">Above all, though, conservative Republicans who have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant to attack a Republican president for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be receding.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want to complain, we want to say something about it, and we're going to as it gets worse," says Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who has been a staunch Contra backer. "But it's like kicking your father in the pants.</seg>
<seg id="12">You hate to do it because he's your father." Mr. Burton says conservatives' unhappiness with Mr. Bush's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of course, neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI. Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the administration's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month, though the committees are likely to let aid continue until February.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most analysts think there's little prospect the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms, and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead of focusing on the Contras, Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government.</seg>
<seg id="18">The administration continues to support SDI, or Star Wars, and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program.</seg>
<seg id="19">And just last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing "compelling reasons" to push ahead with SDI and saying he'd urge President Bush to veto a defense bill with "inadequate" funding for the program.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI.</seg>
<seg id="21">The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding, and in the end the program's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year.</seg>
<seg id="22">And while the defense secretary is speaking out, President Bush himself hasn't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum up support, as President Reagan did.</seg>
<seg id="23">The administration also acknowledges that it isn't pursuing Mr. Reagan's original vision of an "impenetrable shield" protecting the whole U.S., but rather a more modest version.</seg>
<seg id="24">More ominous to SDI supporters, the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty.</seg>
<seg id="27">It will be hard down the road to persuade Congress to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy, charges that the administration's "professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity."</seg>
<seg id="29">Still, proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense political tides have turned against arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI -- particularly when the public perceives the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev.</seg>
<seg id="30">In fact, because communism seems to be beating a global retreat, some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs. "The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us cannot get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing," says Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes.</seg>
<seg id="32">But they say they can't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide.</seg>
<seg id="33">One longtime champion of these programs in Congress, Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, is distracted by questions about his ethics, conservatives note.</seg>
<seg id="34">Other conservative champions, like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a longtime SDI advocate, don't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan.</seg>
<seg id="35">Above all, though, proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support. "For there to be wind in the sails of any program, the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails," says Rep. Burton.</seg>
<seg id="36">All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What I'd like to see, if he is up to it, is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI," the congressman says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine</seg>
<seg id="2">Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.</seg>
<seg id="3">His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."</seg>
<seg id="7">"No, no, no, no , no.</seg>
<seg id="8">What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They want to promote themselves by using my name.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's normal.</seg>
<seg id="11">They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."</seg>
<seg id="15">The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.</seg>
<seg id="16">After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."</seg>
<seg id="18">The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."</seg>
<seg id="20">The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers</seg>
<seg id="2">The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.</seg>
<seg id="9">BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."</seg>
<seg id="17">Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.</seg>
<seg id="5">Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rosenstein denied the report.</seg>
<seg id="7">But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."</seg>
<seg id="14">Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.</seg>
<seg id="15">Host Chris Wallace asked why.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="17">She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."</seg>
<seg id="19">Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.</seg>
<seg id="20">We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="21">Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Solo press conferences are rare.</seg>
<seg id="23">In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.</seg>

<seg id="1">THROUGHOUT THE 1980s, investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning.</seg>
<seg id="2">Capital has been democratized, and people want in.</seg>
<seg id="3">Too often, however, small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk, without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit! This is particularly good news for those who hate risk, who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way.</seg>
<seg id="5">You know who you are.</seg>
<seg id="6">My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity, I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools, if only to assuage my father-in-law, who believes in such things.</seg>
<seg id="8">So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs, and tinkered with stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market.</seg>
<seg id="9">Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative.</seg>
<seg id="10">Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I've invested in during this prosperous decade (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20, 1989).</seg>
<seg id="11">Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985, at which point the industry, while not lighting up any Christmas trees, began a slow recovery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Likewise, mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was, for me, a serious investment.</seg>
<seg id="13">By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she'd "never seen anything like it." Concerned for her state of mind, I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market, which was booming until I entered it in late 1988, at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Disgusted, I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution, and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me: I was doing it already! We've all got money to spend, some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bank it?</seg>
<seg id="17">Not really! Sock it away in long-term instruments?</seg>
<seg id="18">Nonsense! Daily living is the best possible investment!</seg>
<seg id="19">Your priorities may be different, but here in Figure 2 is where I've chosen to build for the future: personal space; automotive pursuits; children's toys; gardening equipment, bulbs and shrubs; and finally, entertainment, perhaps the best investment of all.</seg>
<seg id="20">All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least, according to my calculations.</seg>
<seg id="22">Personal space (Figure 3) has grown 35% annually over the course of the decade, a performance that would compare positively with an investment in, say, synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles, which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day.</seg>
<seg id="23">The assortment of expensive children's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms (Figure 4) has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except, perhaps, for my record collection, whose worth, I think it's safe to say, is incalculable.</seg>
<seg id="24">Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy (Figure 5), with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60% of the car's original value.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to my calculations, these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $22,000 on the open market (Figure 6), where I plan to offer it shortly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns, shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers.</seg>
<seg id="28">My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold, according to my conservative calculations.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the same time, my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning.</seg>
<seg id="30">Over the course of the decade, for instance, my return on investment in the area of poker alone (Figures 7A and 7B) has been most impressive, showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way my associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="31">With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage.</seg>
<seg id="32">My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it.</seg>
<seg id="33">But with every step I take, I'm building wealth.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.</seg>
<seg id="4">"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="6">An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.</seg>
<seg id="7">Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.</seg>
<seg id="9">He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.</seg>

<seg id="2">Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new Tory plans</seg>
<seg id="3">The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters</seg>
<seg id="4">The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK</seg>
<seg id="5">The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless</seg>
<seg id="6">Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.</seg>
<seg id="7">The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.</seg>
<seg id="8">The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="9">The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.</seg>
<seg id="14">He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.</seg>
<seg id="18">And that means fixing our broken housing market.</seg>
<seg id="19">Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.</seg>
<seg id="21">For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."</seg>

<seg id="1">Dennis Farney's Oct. 13 page-one article "River of Despair," about the poverty along the Mississippi, fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern Arkansas, only a few miles from the river.</seg>
<seg id="2">Although we were white, the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people Mr. Farney writes about.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fortunately, an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though I've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world, I've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second, third or fourth generations of the same families.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers, people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following World War II, when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families, the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security, no skills in the workplace, no hope for their future except welfare.</seg>
<seg id="8">And today, many of their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren remain on welfare.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies that began during New Deal days.</seg>
<seg id="10">Or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums.</seg>
<seg id="11">Farmers in the Midwest and other areas have suffered, but those along the Mississippi continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery.</seg>
<seg id="12">And when they were no longer needed, they were turned loose unprepared to build lives of their own.</seg>

<seg id="18">Sadly, the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open, river traffic to increase, government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because we refuse to face the tough answers, the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees, for the media and politicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism, teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance.</seg>
<seg id="23">Does the Delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents, black and white, do not realize racism alienates potential employers?</seg>
<seg id="24">Should we focus on the region's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards, mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways (abstinence or contraceptives) of decreasing teen pregnancy?</seg>

<seg id="37">For years, we tried to ignore the problem of poverty, and now that it has gotten out of hand it's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in "Sugar Ditch," but when you travel to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York, the same problems exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">The only difference is, in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room, with rusty pipes called plumbing, rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'</seg>
<seg id="2">Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.</seg>
<seg id="4">He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I wanted to play for my country as a player.</seg>
<seg id="6">I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.</seg>
<seg id="8">That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."</seg>
<seg id="9">Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="15">He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.</seg>
<seg id="20">But playing can be tough.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.</seg>
<seg id="22">I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.</seg>
<seg id="23">I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."</seg>

<seg id="1">Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds</seg>
<seg id="2">The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.</seg>
<seg id="7">Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="9">Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."</seg>
<seg id="10">Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="11">Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.</seg>
<seg id="12">It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.</seg>
<seg id="13">The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."</seg>
<seg id="14">Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.</seg>

<seg id="2">A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.</seg>
<seg id="3">To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."</seg>
<seg id="5">The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.</seg>
<seg id="7">With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.</seg>
<seg id="9">Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)</seg>
<seg id="11">Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.</seg>
<seg id="12">But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."</seg>
<seg id="14">Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think this is a genus idea.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.</seg>
<seg id="18">The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a genius product," one wrote.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."</seg>
<seg id="22">At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.</seg>
<seg id="23">The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.</seg>
<seg id="26">By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="28">During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border</seg>
<seg id="2">The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.</seg>
<seg id="4">The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.</seg>
<seg id="12">The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="13">Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.</seg>
<seg id="14">They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.</seg>

<seg id="2">Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="4">"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."</seg>
<seg id="7">The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.</seg>
<seg id="8">France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."</seg>
<seg id="12">The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.</seg>
<seg id="13">UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."</seg>
<seg id="16">UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.</seg>

<seg id="1">I approached "Mastergate," Larry Gelbart's new comedy at the Criterion Center, with considerable trepidation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Nothing, I assumed, would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the Iran-Contra affair.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had underestimated, however, both Mr. Gelbart's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran-Contra, it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, at one point Merry Chase (Melinda Mullins), a cool, carefully coiffed television announcer, recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years, concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Onstage, a congressional hearing is in progress, complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background.</seg>
<seg id="7">The witness table is center stage and below it, the paraphernalia for the ever-present media, in this case TNN, the Total News Network.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only are there camera operators on all sides, but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater.</seg>
<seg id="9">The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing -- the witnesses, the lawyers, the interrogators and the news media -- are performers.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the story of "Mastergate" unfolds, we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The man, it seems, has a Lichtenstein corporation, licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas.</seg>
<seg id="13">He himself lives in a "consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland." The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MPI).</seg>
<seg id="14">Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI, but before it can, a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter, the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency.</seg>
<seg id="15">The lowly agent, Abel Lamb, who as you might guess, is being led to the slaughter, is ordered to take over the studio.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon the studio is producing a $40 million picture called "Tet, the Motion Picture," to distinguish it from "Tet, the Offensive," as well as "Tet, the Book" and "Tet, the Album." The picture, to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador, is a cover for sending $800 million of arms to Los Otros, the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua, which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega, a former podiatrist, who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle, Mr. Gelbart's stand in for Col. Oliver North.</seg>
<seg id="18">Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings.</seg>
<seg id="19">Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle, mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism; Jeff Weiss is fire, brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers; Joseph Daly has the perfect "aw, shucks" demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses' wives.</seg>
<seg id="20">With one she is pregnant, with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag, and as the vice president's wife she rushes in with white hair, wearing a tailored suit and pearls, imitating Barbara Bush's gestures down to the last detail.</seg>
<seg id="21">Though it's clear that Mr. Gelbart's sympathies do not lie with the far right, it's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs, taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language. "Mastergate" is subtitled "a play on words," and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone.</seg>
<seg id="23">He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a "meteoric disappearance" and found himself "handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs."</seg>
<seg id="24">This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness, however.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation, the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides.</seg>
<seg id="26">As the hearings begin, the self-important Sen. Bowman (Jerome Kilty) announces: "Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset: We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape." Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese: "Without further monetary-stroke-military aid, scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers, who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us, were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle." At another point he intones: "Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy."</seg>
<seg id="27">The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so, as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably.</seg>
<seg id="28">Most of the evening, though, is filled with rare and welcome wit.</seg>
<seg id="29">In "Mastergate," Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater: sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why Trump Will Win a Second Term</seg>
<seg id="2">By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="3">In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"</seg>
<seg id="4">As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.</seg>
<seg id="9">She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.</seg>
<seg id="10">The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why? she asked.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is entertainment value in the chaos.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.</seg>
<seg id="16">And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.</seg>
<seg id="17">I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.</seg>

<seg id="22">"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.</seg>

<seg id="1">The rationale for responding to your customers' needs faster than the competition can is clear: Your company will benefit in terms of market share, customer satisfaction and profitability.</seg>
<seg id="2">In fact, managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, for many, managing speed does not come naturally.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Most of us grew up believing in the axioms `Haste makes waste' and `Don't cut corners, ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed," says Dean Cassell, vice president for product integrity at Grumman Corp. "But in the real world, you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers."</seg>
<seg id="6">Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed, and shift some responsibility for analyzing, improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees.</seg>
<seg id="8">One team at the Federal Express Ground Operations station in Natick, Mass., focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation: the morning package sort.</seg>
<seg id="9">Every morning, tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the Natick Ground Station from Boston's Logan Airport, carrying the day's package load.</seg>
<seg id="10">In peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="11">The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery, so couriers can be on the road by 8:35.</seg>
<seg id="12">No customer is present at the morning package sort, but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We're committed to deliver the customer's package by a stated time, usually 10:30," notes Glenn Mortimer, a Federal Express courier who led the Natick team. "The sooner our vans hit the road each morning, the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation."</seg>
<seg id="14">Following a problem-solving formula used by teams throughout Federal Express, members of the Natick team monitored their morning routine, carefully noting where and when the work group's resources were used effectively and where they were idle, waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We suspected there was downtime built into our process.</seg>
<seg id="16">But we didn't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering," Mr. Mortimer says. "We used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good." The team even created a points system to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most to reduce package-sort cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Monitoring shows that the Natick team's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort," reports James Barksdale, chief operating officer at Federal Express. "The vans leave at least 15 minutes earlier, on average, than they used to.</seg>
<seg id="19">And service levels have increased to the point where they're consistently above 99%."</seg>
<seg id="20">A cross-functional team at Union Carbide's Tonawanda, N.Y., facility, which produces air-separation plants, followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering, scheduling and purchasing personnel," reports Alan Westendorf, director of quality. "First, they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air-separation plant actually gets built.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then they identified snags in the process."</seg>
<seg id="23">The Tonawanda team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line.</seg>
<seg id="24">The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways," Mr. Westendorf concludes. "First, we have better quality assurance than ever, because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work.</seg>
<seg id="26">Second, we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product."</seg>
<seg id="27">At Grumman's Aircraft Systems Division, a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract.</seg>
<seg id="28">The team was composed of representatives from engineering, manufacturing, corporate estimating, flight test, material, quality control, and other departments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal," says Carl Anton, configuration-data manager for Grumman's A-6 combat aircraft program. "But instead of gathering their input piecemeal, we formed the team, which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved."</seg>
<seg id="30">Armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information, each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal, submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule. "We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly, because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team," Mr. Anton explains.</seg>
<seg id="31">The team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals. "The team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate.</seg>
<seg id="32">The result was a more thoughtful, complete and competitive proposal," Mr. Anton concludes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The successes achieved at Federal Express, Union Carbide and Grumman suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage.</seg>
<seg id="34">Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="35">They effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="36">And they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Secretary of State Baker, we read, decided to kill a speech that Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert, was going to give to a student colloquium, the National Collegiate Security Conference.</seg>
<seg id="2">We keep wondering what Mr. Gates wanted to say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev's need for "a stable currency, free and competitive markets, private property and real prices" and other pie-in-the-sky reforms.</seg>
<seg id="4">Perhaps he'd have called for "a decentralized political and economic system" without a dominant communist party.</seg>
<seg id="5">Or political arrangements "to alleviate the grievances and demands of Soviet ethnic minorities and republics." Why, a Bob Gates might even have said, "Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits."</seg>
<seg id="6">If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things, we would now be hearing about "discord" and "disarray" on foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail, just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's somehow OK for Secretary Baker himself, however, to say all the same things.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, he did; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">So far as we can see, there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker, Mr. Quayle, the Mr. Gates we've read, or for that matter President Bush.</seg>
<seg id="11">They all understand point one: Nothing the U.S. can do will make much difference in whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds with perestroika.</seg>
<seg id="12">Perhaps Mr. Gates would emphasize more than Mr. Baker the many hurdles the Soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="13">But everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's problems result from the failure of his own system.</seg>
<seg id="14">They can be relieved only by changing that system, not by pouring Western money into it.</seg>
<seg id="15">GATT membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap, nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the other hand, so long as Mr. Gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire, everyone we've heard agrees that the U.S. can benefit by engaging him.</seg>
<seg id="17">If a deal can be made to cut the world's Ortegas loose from Moscow, why not?</seg>
<seg id="18">We don't expect much good from nuclear-arms control, but conventional-arms talks might demilitarize Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing in the least contradictory in all this, and it would be nice to think that Washington could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated, complex view.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the Bush administration for not "helping" Mr. Gorbachev.</seg>
<seg id="21">So every time a Bush official raises a doubt about Mr. Gorbachev, the Washington community shouts "Cold War" and "timidity," and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out to reply, "Mr.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bush wants perestroika to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr. Baker seems especially sensitive to the Washington ailment known as Beltway-itis.</seg>
<seg id="24">Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate, clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism, and fainting spells when someone writes the word "controversy." As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times: "Baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press." In short, the problem is not intra-administration disagreement, but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail, and its political opponents will ask "Who lost Gorbachev?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Baker may want to avoid criticism from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World, not just Congress.</seg>
<seg id="26">In any case, he's likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues, the more leaks will pop up all around Washington, a lesson once learned by Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="27">Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational.</seg>
<seg id="28">We note that in Rome yesterday Defense Secretary Cheney said that European euphoria over Mr. Gorbachev is starting to be tempered by a recognition of "the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="29">It is in the Western interest to see Mr. Gorbachev succeed.</seg>
<seg id="30">The odds are against him, as he himself would no doubt tell you.</seg>
<seg id="31">The ultimate outcome depends on what he does, not on what we do.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret, these are not very complicated thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="33">Surely there is someone in the administration, maybe Bob Gates, who could explain them to college students, or even schoolchildren.</seg>

<seg id="1">Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president.</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi, who will become vice chairman.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa, Japan's second-largest securities firm.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Japanese firms, the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations, while the chairman's role is more a ceremonial one.</seg>
<seg id="5">The title of chief executive officer isn't used.</seg>
<seg id="6">While people within Daiwa, particularly internationalists, expected that Mr. Dozen, 52, would eventually become Daiwa's president, the speed of his promotion surprised many.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was only earlier this year that the jovial, easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daiwa is one of the world's largest securities firms.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of March 31, the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen ($5.64 billion).</seg>
<seg id="11">For the six months ended Sept. 30, Daiwa reported unconsolidated (parent company) net income of 79.03 billion yen ($556.5 million) on revenue of 332.38 billion yen ($2.34 billion).</seg>
<seg id="12">Both figures were record highs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan's domestic markets, which should mean increased competition.</seg>
<seg id="14">All of Japan's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., the world's largest, Nikko Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets.</seg>
<seg id="15">While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable, if at all, in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="16">American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities.</seg>
<seg id="17">And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months, they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand.</seg>
<seg id="20">When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors. "He made desperate efforts, using the yellow pages from beginning to end," said Koji Yoneyama, president of Daiwa's U.S. unit. "But not a single piece of paper was sold."</seg>
<seg id="21">By his own account, Mr. Dozen didn't do much better with U.S. bonds.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an interview a few months ago, he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc., he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he couldn't sell any. "Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds?</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe it's crazy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Upon returning to New York, "Exhausted, I got into a taxicab, and the woman driver said: `Americans make better fishermen, '" he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="27">Undaunted, Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa's goal is to build "a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it."</seg>
<seg id="28">He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures, options, mortgaged-backed securities, computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Dozen said Daiwa's strengths were its large capital base, its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959.</seg>
<seg id="31">Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms, he began his career peddling stock to individual investors.</seg>
<seg id="32">In his climb to the top, Mr. Dozen also headed the company's stock-exchange division, its fixed-income units and its international operations. "He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience; he is very well-balanced," said Takuro Isoda, chairman of Daiwa's U.S. unit in New York.</seg>
<seg id="33">But it Mr. Dozen's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="34">Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies' earnings.</seg>
<seg id="35">And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force "would be fragile," said a Daiwa executive.</seg>
<seg id="36">If Mr. Dozen has a weakness, it may be his golf game. "He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball, like a farmer," said Mr. Yoneyama.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.</seg>
<seg id="3">This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.</seg>
<seg id="5">The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).</seg>
<seg id="7">Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.</seg>

<seg id="1">The 1986 tax overhaul, the biggest achievement of President Reagan's second term, is beginning to fall apart, and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill.</seg>
<seg id="2">Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who don't itemize their deductions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes.</seg>
<seg id="5">And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Everything is up for grabs," says Theodore Groom, a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Adds Robert Juliano, the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses: "It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again."</seg>
<seg id="8">The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains, an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other fundamental "reforms" of the 1986 act have been threatened as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts, and also to bring back income averaging for farmers, a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years.</seg>
<seg id="12">As part of the same bill, the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations, in what committee member Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.) calls a "feeding frenzy" of special-interest legislating.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops.</seg>
<seg id="14">To be sure, the full Senate, facing a fast-approaching budget deadline, last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill.</seg>
<seg id="15">But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts, including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There isn't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). "You'll see the annual unraveling of it."</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's back to tax-give-away time for the select few," says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.</seg>
<seg id="19">Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees, he adds, "Next year, every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen's door, on Danny Rostenkowski's door."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many groups aren't waiting that long.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just last week, a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities, companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes. "It's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good," commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even lobbyists for heavy industry, one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill, are encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="23">The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs "creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation (write-offs) or investment credits," says Paul Huard, a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve "competitiveness."</seg>
<seg id="25">In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation, groups are lobbying to make sure they aren't left off the gravy train.</seg>
<seg id="26">Real-estate interests, for example, are protesting an omission in President Bush's capital-gains proposal: It doesn't include real-estate gains. "If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains, they certainly want to be part of it," says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the House-passed tax bill, Mr. Thevenot got his wish; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision.</seg>
<seg id="28">But Sotheby's, Christie's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs.</seg>
<seg id="29">They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment. "Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets," the letter states.</seg>
<seg id="30">All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.</seg>
<seg id="31">In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates, the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions, deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others.</seg>
<seg id="32">The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally, and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses, also known as passive losses, that made many tax shelters possible.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many other tax benefits also were swept away.</seg>
<seg id="35">This year Congress, with prodding from President Bush, has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code.</seg>
<seg id="36">It appears likely that, this year or next, some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted.</seg>
<seg id="37">Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created.</seg>
<seg id="38">The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The '86 act was a fluke.</seg>
<seg id="40">They wanted reform and they got a revolution," says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio).</seg>
<seg id="41">So, is the tax code now open game again?</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Juliano thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="43">One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School. "I'm too old to waste a weekend, but that's what I did," the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans. "These days, anything can happen."</seg>

<seg id="1">Friday's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash, and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly.</seg>
<seg id="2">Still, the lesson is about the same: On Friday the 13th, the market was spooked by Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover, and it's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt.</seg>
<seg id="4">Still, the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business.</seg>
<seg id="5">This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn: the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut.</seg>
<seg id="6">The real value of all shares, after all, is directly impacted by the tax on any profits (all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not "ordinary income").</seg>
<seg id="7">And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month.</seg>
<seg id="8">An hour before Friday's plunge, that provision was stripped from the tax bill, leaving it with $5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a great deal to be said, to be sure, for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill.</seg>
<seg id="10">It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery.</seg>
<seg id="11">For one thing, no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens, promises of a cleaner bill are suspect.</seg>
<seg id="13">Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco.</seg>
<seg id="14">To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge, they are another instance of Washington's sticky fingers.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course, at some point the market will start to reject them.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the airlines are scarcely a clear case, given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner, who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Worse, Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon.</seg>
<seg id="18">James Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids.</seg>
<seg id="19">It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to "review" any bid for 15% or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $1 billion or more.</seg>
<seg id="20">So the UAL deal has problems, and the market loses 190 points.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congratulations, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the 1987 crash, remember, the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even more important, in our view, was the Treasury's threat to thrash the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Treasury is doing the same thing today; thankfully, the dollar is not under 1987-style pressure.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also, traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges.</seg>
<seg id="26">They are better capitalized.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Fed promises any needed liquidity.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Big Board's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved; it will be interesting to learn if "circuit breakers" prove to be a good idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any event, some traders see stocks as underpriced today, unlike 1987.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is nothing wrong with the market that can't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="32">But on the bearish side, that may be too much to expect.</seg>

<seg id="2">Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.</seg>
<seg id="4">State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.</seg>
<seg id="6">The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.</seg>
<seg id="7">As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.</seg>
<seg id="9">Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.</seg>

<seg id="2">The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.</seg>

<seg id="9">The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Americans face several of these inflection points now.</seg>
<seg id="11">What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?</seg>
<seg id="12">Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="14">"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?</seg>
<seg id="15">And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?</seg>
<seg id="16">If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="3">A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.</seg>
<seg id="6">Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.</seg>
<seg id="7">They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.</seg>
<seg id="8">Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.</seg>

<seg id="1">Many in Washington say President Bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2">We have a better idea: Dismantle HUD to pay for the war on drugs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Housing and Urban Development's budget is $17 billion.</seg>
<seg id="4">From what we and the nation have been reading, the money isn't being spent very well.</seg>
<seg id="5">The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that takes money, take it away from this discredited federal department.</seg>
<seg id="7">But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, they're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This month, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD. No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="10">Congress is unlikely to go even that far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members.</seg>
<seg id="12">They were appalled, for instance, that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies.</seg>
<seg id="13">These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also give those in Congress political credit for bringing home the pork, and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rep. Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants a $6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue.</seg>
<seg id="17">HUD says the project doesn't qualify, and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the hearing, Rep. Oakar started wailing about "phoney baloney regulations" that would stand between her and "housing for downtown Cleveland." Rep. Chalmers Wylie, an Ohio Republican, rallied to the cause: "I think the gentlelady is making an important statement.</seg>
<seg id="19">The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there's something wrong, I think is most unfortunate."</seg>
<seg id="20">We're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with HUD.</seg>
<seg id="21">Our view is that given Congress's attitude toward HUD, the place probably is beyond reform.</seg>
<seg id="22">For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the process HUD has wasted untold billions, created slums and invited corruption.</seg>
<seg id="24">Much of HUD's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class.</seg>
<seg id="25">That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration, which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $4 billion in the hole.</seg>
<seg id="26">Selling the FHA's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor, and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units.</seg>
<seg id="28">The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even suburban Prince George's County, Md., reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year, most of them drug-related.</seg>
<seg id="31">Innocent bystanders often are the victims.</seg>
<seg id="32">A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle.</seg>
<seg id="33">A three-year-old Brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer.</seg>
<seg id="34">Decent life in the inner cities won't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Until then, the billions HUD spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there.</seg>
<seg id="37">No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged.</seg>
<seg id="38">Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals, we disagree.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine HUD has become and channel the resources into the drug war.</seg>

<seg id="1">Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.</seg>
<seg id="3">About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.</seg>
<seg id="5">"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's where to begin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.</seg>
<seg id="12">Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.</seg>
<seg id="14">You would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you're incapacitated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?</seg>
<seg id="17">Spell out those details in a written plan so that you're ready.</seg>

<seg id="1">Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia</seg>
<seg id="2">At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.</seg>
<seg id="3">With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:</seg>
<seg id="6">Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.</seg>
<seg id="9">The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.</seg>
<seg id="14">A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:</seg>
<seg id="17">2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.</seg>
<seg id="18">2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.</seg>
<seg id="20">2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.</seg>
<seg id="21">2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than 1,100 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.</seg>
<seg id="24">2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="25">No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.</seg>
<seg id="26">2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.</seg>
<seg id="27">The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.</seg>

<seg id="2">Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.</seg>
<seg id="3">Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.</seg>
<seg id="5">Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.</seg>
<seg id="6">He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.</seg>
<seg id="7">Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.</seg>
<seg id="10">In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.</seg>
<seg id="11">His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.</seg>
<seg id="14">His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="1">In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article, "It's the World Bank's Turn to Adjust," Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2">The article is, unfortunately, replete with outrageous distortions.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of Mr. Roberts's observations is that the Bank's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is just not so.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of June 30, 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1% of the Bank's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is an enviably low level.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $800 million against possible loan losses.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the same fiscal year, by the way, the Bank's net income was a robust $1.1 billion after provisions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank goes about development, financial markets have confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="11">This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another of Mr. Roberts's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good "by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development." Here, too, Mr. Roberts is way off the mark.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Our traditional project loans have, for instance, supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector, sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient, autonomous agencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">By and large, these efforts have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="16">In my home region, Latin America, much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank's adjustment lending.</seg>
<seg id="18">What are the facts on this type of lending?</seg>
<seg id="19">The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="20">As their name implies, these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness.</seg>
<seg id="21">Typically, these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy, to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector.</seg>
<seg id="22">Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank's.</seg>
<seg id="23">Over the years, it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most recently, the Bank Group has been expanded to include the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate.</seg>
<seg id="25">These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government, as Mr. Roberts alleges.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rather, they reflect the Bank's time-tested, pragmatic approach, which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use.</seg>

<seg id="1">Solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot, because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited.</seg>
<seg id="2">The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting, so he doesn't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="3">Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler, more audience-friendly approach.</seg>
<seg id="4">Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi, which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time."</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work (though a touch of the old Tashi still survives) and now goes on the road with piano, bass, a slide show, and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop, with a few notable exceptions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening.</seg>
<seg id="7">But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="8">He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly.</seg>
<seg id="9">His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum, dubbed "A Musical Odyssey," was a case in point.</seg>
<seg id="10">It felt more like a party, or a highly polished jam session with a few friends, than a classical concert.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clad in his trademark black velvet suit, the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album, "Inner Voices," had just been released, that his family was in the front row, and that it was his mother's birthday, so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record.</seg>
<seg id="12">He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality.</seg>
<seg id="14">And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez.</seg>
<seg id="16">An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas, beginning with "Golden Rain," a lilting, laid-back lead in to the uptempo "Sky," which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bach's "Air" followed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century," and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions, cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas.</seg>
<seg id="19">Keeping the mood light, the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms, devised by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to Hindemith's dry theory-teaching techniques, and then, with Mr. Gomez, soared and improvised on the composer's tight "Bebop Etudes."</seg>
<seg id="20">The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins, who appears on "Inner Voices." Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace." "Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation.</seg>
<seg id="22">That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?</seg>
<seg id="24">Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone?</seg>
<seg id="25">Either way it was a pity, because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing. (Mr.</seg>
<seg id="26">Reich's new "Different Trains" for string quartet uses the technique magisterially.)</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it: He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="28">He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it.</seg>
<seg id="29">The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces.</seg>
<seg id="30">It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable.</seg>
<seg id="31">Is this the future of chamber music?</seg>
<seg id="32">Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell, but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements, served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals?</seg>
<seg id="33">What's next?</seg>
<seg id="34">Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartets?</seg>
<seg id="35">It was not an unpleasant evening, certainly, thanks to the high level of performance, the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas, and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections.</seg>
<seg id="36">But it was neither deep nor lasting: light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms.</seg>

<seg id="1">The White House has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation's food supply.</seg>
<seg id="2">The proposed changes, which are scheduled to be announced today, would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods, according to federal officials.</seg>
<seg id="3">Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they are already objecting to, among other things, a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides."It's a tremendous disappointment," said Janet Hathaway, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides, with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="7">There already are proposals pending in Congress to overhaul pesticide law.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year's Alar scare, when the EPA was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen, a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier.</seg>
<seg id="9">The agency has since acted to remove Alar from the nation's grocery shelves by May 31, 1991, and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called Delaney Paradox.</seg>
<seg id="11">Under the Delaney clause, which applies to processed food, a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the EPA's tolerance level.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among other changes, the White House wants to:</seg>
<seg id="14">-- Give the EPA more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="15">-- Speed up the process for removing a pesticide that isn't an imminent hazard.</seg>
<seg id="16">-- Bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard.</seg>
<seg id="17">-- Give the EPA added discretion to set "negligible risk" levels for pesticide residues in processed food.</seg>
<seg id="18">Chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred, but those that fall below these levels would be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="19">-- Allow the EPA to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost.</seg>

<seg id="2">Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.</seg>
<seg id="6">Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.</seg>
<seg id="9">Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="12">The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.</seg>
<seg id="14">Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.</seg>
<seg id="19">David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Regarding your Oct. 4 page-one article "Bad Blood" on the generic-drug battle: The Epilepsy Institute is not just a patient-advocacy organization.</seg>

<seg id="3">The institute's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joint Report on Parallel Audits of Expenditure on the Construction of the Motorway Prague – Dresden</seg>
<seg id="2">Background</seg>
<seg id="3">Without the trans-European motorway networks the high traffic volumes between the member states in modern, united Europe would be subject to considerable constraints and losses in quality.</seg>
<seg id="4">High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising Europeans’ standard of living.</seg>
<seg id="5">Putting in place the right conditions for fast, safe, reliable and efficient passenger and freight transport is an important government task.</seg>
<seg id="6">Performing this task is a highly demanding exercise in organisational, technical and financial terms.</seg>
<seg id="7">When putting into place and extending a sustainable European transport infrastructure system, decision-makers often have to reach difficult compromises with European and national policy interests, for example, in preserving the environment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Building transport infrastructure is expensive, especially owing to the environmental protection measures that are required.</seg>
<seg id="9">Carefully considered action and decision-making by government departments when preparing and procuring transport construction may bring significant savings of public funds that can be channelled into other beneficial uses.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the tasks of audit institutions is to identify shortcomings that prevent ensuring the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Audit institutions should not merely draw government departments’ attention to the shortcomings identified; they should also recommend measures designed to improve the state of affairs, to the benefit of citizens and to the benefit of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Summary</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ) conducted parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).</seg>
<seg id="14">The motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="15">By working together with the NKÚ, the BRH was able to audit in depth the efficiency of the funds used for building the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result of working closely with the BRH the NKÚ was furnished for comparative purposes with the necessary data of German cost levels of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the year 2000 the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a treaty on building a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In accordance with the construction progress, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the public procurement process, however, the Roads and Motorways Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter “RMD”) committed errors that led to the tender being prolonged and time for construction shortened.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contract with the contractor was therefore signed later than envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure completion in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, the RMD had to accept a considerable increase in the price of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">As part of the joint audit effort motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared based on the prices per square metre of area of the bridge structure.</seg>
<seg id="24">The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges that came at a high cost per square metre.</seg>
<seg id="25">This analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge as compared to other large bridges having a length of over 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="26">The price increase could also be attributed to the delays occurred in the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">When auditors analysed the costs of tunnel structures they found that the prices of tunnels are considerably higher on the D 8 motorway than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="28">The BRH and NKÚ now possess a database of prices for bridges and tunnels on which they can rely in future audit missions into the efficiency of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Concerning the construction of bridges the two audit institutions recommend the following: standardising bridge constructions and using composite steel-concrete and special structures only if prestressed steelconcrete bridges are not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The main features of the cooperation were teamwork and informality.</seg>
<seg id="31">Throughout the parallel audit, the auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Introduction</seg>
<seg id="33">This report informs about the conduct and the results of parallel audit missions regarding the funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and the A 17 in Germany).</seg>
<seg id="34">The audit missions focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure occurred.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parallel audits were performed by the BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">The parallel audit work was conducted in the years 2005 and 2006.</seg>
<seg id="37">The NKÚ scrutinised the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of approximately CZK 20 billion incl. VAT in expenditure (approx. € 690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.</seg>
<seg id="38">Out of this amount € 64 million were planned to be used from European funds (ISPA).</seg>
<seg id="39">Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÚ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">The funds used for building all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to some € 670 million, where € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).</seg>
<seg id="41">The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Dresden – Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe – Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV.</seg>
<seg id="42">The D 8 runs from Prague to the state frontier via Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="43">The A 17 runs from the Czech/German border to Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the time of audit, the frontier sections of both motorways were under construction.</seg>
<seg id="45">These sections have been opened on December 21, 2006.</seg>
<seg id="46">While on the German side the motorway is completed up to Dresden, on the Czech side, the D 8 is not completed, because section No. 0805 at a length of 16.4 km through the Central Bohemian Highlands between Rehlovice and ovosice is still in the preparatory phase.</seg>
<seg id="47">The stretch 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad abem is planned to pass through the Protected Countryside Area in the Central Bohemian Highlands.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to forecasts performed in the Czech Republic in 2001, traffic volume on the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22 940 vehicles per day in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to German forecasts traffic volumes at the Czech border will total some 25 000 vehicles per day in the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="50">In the year 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a Treaty on connecting German Motorway A 17 and Czech Motorway D 8 on the common state frontiers by constructing a border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="51">Since the two states participated in building the bridge; examining the construction of the individual bridge was therefore an important aspect of parallel audit missions by the two audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="52">Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ</seg>
<seg id="53">From mid 2005, the two supreme audit institutions discussed to work closely in auditing the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.</seg>
<seg id="54">Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:</seg>
<seg id="55">1.</seg>
<seg id="56">Germany co-finances the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Planning and construction are incumbent on the Czech road construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore, the BRH had no possibility of auditing this construction project itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">2.</seg>
<seg id="60">The NKÚ did not have a comparative database needed for assessing whether the funds were used economically regarding the overall cost level of bridges and tunnels on the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="61">3.</seg>
<seg id="62">The NKÚ needed to examine the effectiveness of expenditure by looking at the motorway’s principal technical parameters, and particularly the arrangement of bridges and tunnels that were meant to provide the same level of quality of use on both sides of the border.</seg>
<seg id="63">After preparatory negotiations, an Agreement on the Coordinated Audit of the D 8/A 17 Motorway was signed on January 4, 2006 by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Joint working meetings between BRH and NKÚ auditors took place throughout 2006 at roughly six to eight week intervals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The meetings addressed current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for auditing the prices of bridges and tunnels, information exchange regarding findings arising from the audit of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.</seg>
<seg id="66">A significant feature of the cooperation was the continuous sharing of information.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the BRH did most of the comparative work on the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the contracting procedures, the NKÚ prepared most of the methodology for scrutinising the prices of bridges and tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="68">In accordance with applicable relevant government audit legislation in the two countries, there are differences in the manner of concluding audit missions in Germany and Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="69">For this reason, the two supreme audit institutions drew up each a separate national report on its audit findings produced.</seg>
<seg id="70">The present report reflects the results achieved in the parallel audit missions.</seg>
<seg id="71">The cooperation will be ended by the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="72">Construction of the border bridge</seg>
<seg id="73">In the Treaty as of the year 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a deadline for completing the border bridge, according to their capabilities, in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="74">They both agreed to postpone this deadline to the end of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="75">The RMD acted as investor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Germany co-finances the construction of the bridge by 42.13 %.</seg>
<seg id="77">In the period up to 1999, RMD had proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 1999 by agreement with its partners in Germany RMD approved a composite steel-concrete structure.</seg>
<seg id="79">They justified this decision by referring to the reduction of pillar pairs from seven to five and the resulting ecological benefit for the valley.</seg>
<seg id="80">In addition, a comparative calculation done by RMD stated that the composite steel-concrete structure would be the less costly option.</seg>
<seg id="81">But there was an error in the calculation.</seg>
<seg id="82">The calculation stated that the new composite steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.</seg>
<seg id="83">In fact, it is 5% longer.</seg>
<seg id="84">RMD committed grave errors in the public procurement procedure.</seg>
<seg id="85">RMD failed to prepare tender documents adequately describing both assessment criteria and sub-criteria used for comparing the bids.</seg>
<seg id="86">This error resulted in subjective and ambiguous assessment by the bids evaluation commission and the managing director respectively.</seg>
<seg id="87">A non-successful bidder contested the results of the tender procedure.</seg>
<seg id="88">The subsequent inquiry by the Office for the Protection of Competition caused the bridge construction contract to be signed later than originally anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="89">That meant that 2004 year summer building season after bid evaluation was lost, and the time for construction of the bridge was shortened.</seg>
<seg id="90">The constructor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but this involved a substantial price increase.</seg>
<seg id="91">The steps offered included dual assembly of the bridge superstructures, a change in the pillar design and erecting an assembly facility.</seg>
<seg id="92">In addition, the constructor was unable to obtain the originally proposed type of steel in the time required.</seg>
<seg id="93">The new type of steel – at a higher cost of some € 4 million borne fully by RMD – made it possible to shorten the time for performing anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently made it possible to cut the overall time needed to build the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compared to the price offered in the bid of some € 18.3 million net, as a result of the accelerated procedure and further funding adjustments, the total cost of the border bridge will rise considerably.</seg>
<seg id="95">Shortened time for works resulted in price increase in the range of some € 5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="96">Currently net costs amount to some € 25.9 million not considering price escalation (as of October 2006).</seg>
<seg id="97">Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels</seg>
<seg id="98">The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was excessively high, and compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.</seg>
<seg id="99">The analysis relied on arithmetical statistics.</seg>
<seg id="100">Tunnels on the D 8 were also compared with equivalent tunnels on motorways (A 71, A 38 and A 4) in Germany;</seg>
<seg id="101">there were no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="102">In preparing this part of the audit, it was important to identify relevant prices accurately.</seg>
<seg id="103">The main principles determined by the two supreme audit institutions for comparing the prices of bridges included the following: to rely on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany differ and are subject to change); not to consider prices for special bridge foundations; to convert prices in CZK into € using the European Central Bank rate applicable on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).</seg>
<seg id="104">Bridges of various construction types (such as steel concrete, prestressed steel-concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes are found on both the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="105">In an effort to homogenise the reviewed bridge constructions, the bridges were divided into categories based on construction type.</seg>
<seg id="106">Within these categories the bridge size was also taken into account in the analyses.</seg>
<seg id="107">Concrete bridges were by far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).</seg>
<seg id="108">The analysis focused chiefly on this category of bridge, as the large size of the sample made it possible to use arithmetical statistics and improved the reliability of results.</seg>
<seg id="109">Audit work revealed that the prices per m2 of concrete bridges on the D 8 and A 17 depend on the bridge size (its length, area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the price per m 2 of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="110">The correlation between price and size is stronger for German bridges than Czech bridges (see graphs below).</seg>
<seg id="111">Two concrete bridges were identified on the A 17 and four on the D 8 whose price is markedly higher.</seg>
<seg id="112">These bridges were identified partly by a method enabling the ascertainment of atypical values in a set of numbers and partly by regressive analysis taking into account the correlation between the bridge price and its size (distance above the regressive curve is a key to identifying atypically expensive bridges).</seg>
<seg id="113">Information about the atypically high price of the said bridges should, however, be regarded merely as an indicator as to which bridges to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="114">In order to be able to make a generally applicable conclusion the causes of the high price would have to be analysed in each identified case.</seg>
<seg id="115">One reason may be inefficient administrative action but it may also have been caused by environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reasons.</seg>
<seg id="116">Given that the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and length might lead one to expect that they would be cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="117">The hypothesis about the lower cost of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by the lower cost of labour in the construction industry in the Czech Republic than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="118">The results of the analysis, however, indicate that the price of concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.</seg>
<seg id="119">Two possible reasons for this state of affairs were identified during joint meetings.</seg>
<seg id="120">1.</seg>
<seg id="121">In Germany most bridges are procured as independent projects.</seg>
<seg id="122">That makes it possible for small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the tender.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the Czech Republic many bridges are procured as part of a contract for a part of motorway route that is several kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="124">Small and medium-sized firms do not take part in this kind of tender, as the job is too big for them.</seg>
<seg id="125">2.</seg>
<seg id="126">There is greater variety in bridge structures used in the Czech Republic than in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="127">In this context the NKÚ found that the type of bridge structure is decided long before it is built.</seg>
<seg id="128">The decision is made during the time when the RMD submits the zoning decision application.</seg>
<seg id="129">At this time the RMD selects bridge types from several alternatives, but economy plays only a minor role in decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="130">A general conclusion regarding bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany would only be possible on the basis of a thorough analysis of the building work market in both countries; that would have been beyond the scope of this audit, however.</seg>
<seg id="131">The border bridge is the most expensive composite steel-concrete bridge on the D 8 and A 17.</seg>
<seg id="132">In the case of tunnels it was found that tunnels on the D 8 cost twice as much as tunnels in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="133">Yet a comparison of the principal technical construction parameters of tunnels on the D 8 and tunnels in Germany revealed no fundamental difference.</seg>
<seg id="134">The considerable price differences could be attributed to the fact that in the Czech Republic, there is no real competition in the tunnel building sector.</seg>
<seg id="135">Nevertheless, the low number of tunnels made it impossible to reach generally applicable conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="136">Effectiveness and efficiency of the motorway Dresden – Prague</seg>
<seg id="137">The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="138">In the same year, the government approved the concept of motorway network development.</seg>
<seg id="139">The D 8 was to be extended step by step from Prague towards the state frontier to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="140">Section No. 0805 through the Central Bohemian Highlands was to be built before the border section No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="141">The Czech Republic is building the D 8 under programme financing.</seg>
<seg id="142">Two objectives of the construction of the D 8 are defined in programme No. 327 220 “Construction of the D 8 Motorway, Prague – Usti nad Labem – Czech/ German State Frontier”:</seg>
<seg id="143">1.</seg>
<seg id="144">improve the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem – national objective;</seg>
<seg id="145">2.</seg>
<seg id="146">improve the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Berlin-Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV – international objective.</seg>
<seg id="147">According to the programme, construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands was scheduled for completion in June 2008 and construction of the border section No. 0807 for June 2007.</seg>
<seg id="148">It should be noted that the deadline for completing the construction is not identical with the deadline for putting into operation.</seg>
<seg id="149">The NKÚ ascertained that the preparatory work for the construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands is currently in the official zoning decision stage.</seg>
<seg id="150">Ecological activists have contested this decision with legal actions.</seg>
<seg id="151">A definitive ruling on the actions is pending.</seg>
<seg id="152">It therefore cannot be ruled out that the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands will be completed several years later than stated in the programme documentation.</seg>
<seg id="153">During summer 2006 the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the term of completing of section No. 0805 up to year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="154">As a result of these circumstances, construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="155">The RMD performed a capital expenditure appraisal of the border section of the D 8 No. 0807 and of section No. 0805 via the Central Bohemian Highlands in the years 1999 – 2001.</seg>
<seg id="156">The investment cost included in this capital expenditure appraisal amounts to some € 639 million together for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.</seg>
<seg id="157">Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR=economic internal return rate)</seg>
<seg id="158">All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="159">Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="160">All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="161">Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 22.000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="162">All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="163">Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="164">The economic analysis performed in 2001 relied on the assumption that the section near the frontier and the Central Bohemian Highlands section would both be finished at the time.</seg>
<seg id="165">At the time of audit it is clear that the Central Bohemian Highlands section will not be opened by the original deadline.</seg>
<seg id="166">That will reduce the aforementioned EIRR values.</seg>
<seg id="167">The ex VAT costs of both sections specified as of 31.12.2005 were € 897 million, i.e. 27.4% higher than the cost level applied in the economic analysis in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="168">There is a risk, however, that section No. 0805 will follow a different, more expensive route, which would impact on the aforementioned economic viability level.</seg>
<seg id="169">As a result of the economic analysis, the construction of both motorway sections is economically viable at a traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="170">The forecast for 2008 indicated 22 940 vehicles per day but a study addressing the issue of detour routes in place of the missing section through the Central Bohemian Highlands reckons with a traffic volume in year 2007 of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day, which puts the investment below the economic viability threshold.</seg>
<seg id="171">A higher traffic load on the detour routes in place of the lacking Central Bohemian Highlands section gives rise to a high probability of congestion and thus also increased external costs that were not taken into account during the original economic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="172">The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR the construction of the D 8 border section was supposed to have will not be attained.</seg>
<seg id="173">Proto je stavba příhraničního úseku D 8 neefektivní.</seg>
<seg id="174">When building the A 17 motorway, cost overruns also occurred similarly to those of the two above sections of the D 8.</seg>
<seg id="175">As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 federal long distance road plan, the German Federal Ministry for Transport assumed a cost of some € 320 million.</seg>
<seg id="176">The resulting cost benefit ratio was 4.6.</seg>
<seg id="177">In the meantime, costs have soared to some € 670 million reducing the cost benefit ratio by more than half.</seg>
<seg id="178">Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÚ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="179">When doing so the BRH found that the relevant authorising states body demanded a landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17 that was not needed.</seg>
<seg id="180">During the course of audit work, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the German road works administration that the tunnel was not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="181">As a result savings were made that accounted for single building cost of some € 10 million and € 0.15 million of annual operating costs.</seg>
<seg id="182">When examining the first section of the A 17 the BRH found that the building project had not been adequately prepared.</seg>
<seg id="183">This is illustrated by the following example:</seg>
<seg id="184">At the planning stage, the road works administration failed to do a survey on the condition of the bedrock at the Dölzschen rock, since it was not easily accessible.</seg>
<seg id="185">Only after the tunnel driving machine reached the rock they made up for it.</seg>
<seg id="186">The tests showed that the interior rock was weathered to a higher extent than expected at the time of tendering.</seg>
<seg id="187">This resulted in costly measures such as anchoring, injections and protection nets against rockfall that amounted to some € 3.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="188">The road work administration had to bear the costs not only for additional extra operations such as the safety measures at the Dölzschen rock but also measures that would not have been needed if the building project had been adequately prepared in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="189">Such expenditures include cost for disrupted building operations (€ 3.2 million), additional training for drilling staff (€ 0.5 million) and soaring wages and expenses on goods as a result of time overruns for the project (€ 7 million).</seg>
<seg id="190">Thus excess costs amounted to some € 10.7 million that were not matched by any additional value.</seg>
<seg id="191">On the basis of the lessons learnt from this project and other projects audited the BRH demanded the Federal Ministry to take more rigorous leadership regarding its oversight over road works.</seg>
<seg id="192">In this context, the Federal Ministry should provide the necessary momentum for road works administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.</seg>
<seg id="193">Benefits of cooperation for the BRH and the NKÚ The cooperation achieved the objectives of both audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="194">The BRH now has audit findings on the preparation, contract public procurement procedure and course of the construction of the border bridge.</seg>
<seg id="195">The two supreme audit institutions developed a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels that can be relied on in future audits.</seg>
<seg id="196">The NKÚ found that the main technical construction parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the A 17 parameters.</seg>
<seg id="197">Auditors of both institutions taking part in the cooperation gained new experiences that can be put to use in future audits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations</seg>
<seg id="2">Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.</seg>
<seg id="9">He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="10">'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to make our own laws in our own country.'</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'</seg>
<seg id="15">Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.</seg>
<seg id="16">'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Please drop Chequers and start listening.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.</seg>
<seg id="20">'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'</seg>
<seg id="22">In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.</seg>
<seg id="23">'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="25">A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="26">Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.</seg>
<seg id="27">'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.</seg>
<seg id="28">'It is a complete farce.</seg>
<seg id="29">There isn't such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors, fighting the urge to spend more, we're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says, "Stop me before I kill again." The Members know they're doing wrong, but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions.</seg>
<seg id="2">Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor the other day after he'd joined the Finance Committee's early-morning pork-barrel revels: "I must tell you . . . I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy." He was turning himself in.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Frankly, as I was walking back to get in my car, I heard many, many people . . . opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in," he said. "As I was driving home, I did not feel very good about myself."</seg>
<seg id="5">We can applaud Mr. Pryor's moment of epiphany, even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again.</seg>
<seg id="6">A good place to start the rehabilitation is a "legislative line-item veto" bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Coats bill, which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors, isn't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead it's a form of "enhanced rescission," giving a President a chance to rescind, or strike, specific spending items that just go too far.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under the proposal, a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of "rescissions" to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50% majority, but then a President could veto that rejection.</seg>
<seg id="11">Congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto.</seg>
<seg id="12">The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget "Reform" Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">Before 1974, a President could "impound," or refuse to spend, funds appropriated by Congress.</seg>
<seg id="14">Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power, but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away.</seg>
<seg id="15">Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by Congress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month.</seg>
<seg id="21">President Bush has endorsed the idea, and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">We're told Senator Pryor isn't yet a co-sponsor, but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions, they'll sign up.</seg>

<seg id="1">You'd think all the stories about well-heeled communities and developers getting HUD grants would prompt Congress to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="2">No way.</seg>
<seg id="3">Congress has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit-ridden Federal Housing Administration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It appears that the only thing Congress is learning from the HUD story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests.</seg>
<seg id="5">Right now, the largest loan the FHA can insure in high-cost housing markets is $101,250.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last week, housing lobbies persuaded Congress to raise the ceiling to $124,875, making FHA loans more accessible to the well-to-do.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it does that at the cost of deepening the taxpayer's exposure if the FHA is forced to pay for more loans going sour.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is no idle fearlast year the FHA lost $4.2 billion in loan defaults.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have in mind for housing.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Senate Banking Committee will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other Senators want to lower the down payments required on FHA-insured loans.</seg>
<seg id="12">That would be a formula for ensuring even more FHA red ink.</seg>
<seg id="13">Experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing-loan default is the down payment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Because a purchaser can use an FHA loan to finance all points and closing costs, the FHA can wind up lending more than a house is worth.</seg>
<seg id="15">If housing prices continue to fall, many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Much the same thing happened with busted S&Ls, a problem Congress just "solved" with a $166 billion bailout.</seg>
<seg id="17">We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with going along with some of the Cranston-Mitchell proposals.</seg>
<seg id="18">That sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next HUD tar pit.</seg>
<seg id="19">A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations.</seg>
<seg id="20">But even if he agrees, Mr. Kemp doesn't write the nation's housing law -- Congress does.</seg>
<seg id="21">And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects.</seg>
<seg id="22">Exhibit A is last week's House vote to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the HUD scandal.</seg>
<seg id="23">None of the grants had been requested by HUD, judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing.</seg>
<seg id="24">More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future HUD scandals lies in forcing Congress to clean up its own act.</seg>
<seg id="25">This week, a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses: the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem -- and a part that's gone. "If HUD is to be reformed," it concluded, Members of Congress will "have to start looking into, and doing something about, the practices of their colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in.</seg>
<seg id="28">Proponents of expanding FHA programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the FHA program is hemorrhaging bad loans.</seg>
<seg id="30">Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms, and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage-grinder.</seg>
<seg id="31">Like the S&L mess before it, this is a problem Congress should be solving, not ignoring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report on audit results in refugee facilities in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">State Property and Financial Means Allocated to Cover the Work of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of Interior</seg>
<seg id="3">Audit no. 04/23 „State Property and Financial Means Allocated to Cover the Work of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of Interior"</seg>
<seg id="4">Audit no. 15/2004 „Audit of the Management of State Property and Finances Earmarked for the Provision of Asylum and Temporary Refuge to Foreigners in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="5">1. Introduction</seg>
<seg id="6">Population migration is a worldwide trend that has become an integral part of the present development stage of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is mainly caused by citizens fleeing from their country of origin or last place of permanent residence to escape persecution, in particular racial, religious, national and political persecution, and to escape military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its objective is to obtain asylum and to integrate into society, primarily in one of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, another major group is formed of foreigners whose reason for migration is poor economic and living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Migration is not a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Specific principles for assisting refugees were laid down by the 1951 Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol of 1967 regarding the legal status of refugees. Signatory countries bound themselves to apply these principles in their foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Convention in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with the international documents they had signed up to; both states confirmed them by enshrining them in national legislation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both countries have also enshrined the provision of asylum in their constitutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">The asylum process and related matters came under scrutiny in parallel audits performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic. The results of both are contained in the joint final report.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cooperation between the two countries' supreme audit offices took place on the basis of the „Treaty on Cooperation in Audit Work" (hereinafter the „Treaty") signed in April 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Treaty the two sides undertook to inform each other about legislation governing asylum procedures in the state of the other party, selected statistical data regarding the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on refugee facilities.</seg>
<seg id="18">The purpose of the parallel audits was to identify common problems and to draw attention to the possible consequences for population migration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooperation consisted in defining a uniform audit programme, exchanging information in the scope set out in the Treaty and in drawing up a joint final report on the audit results.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the first meeting, which took place on 5-7 April 2004, common sets of audit topics and common audit preparatory procedures were defined.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the second meeting on 28-30 June 2004, common (overlapping) points of the audit programme were specified.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the third meeting on 8-10 November 2004, there was an exchange of experience from the ongoing audits.</seg>
<seg id="23">The forms of outputs from the audits were finalised, and the preliminary structure and content of the joint final report defined. The report was drawn up on 14-17 February 2005 at the last joint session.</seg>
<seg id="24">The audits were performed in parallel in the period from September 2004 to January 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">The audit in the Czech Republic was performed by auditors from the Defence and Security Department and from selected territorial departments.</seg>
<seg id="26">The auditees were the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic (hereinafter „Mol CR") and are Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter „RFA").</seg>
<seg id="27">In Slovak Republic the audit was performed by the Defence, Interior and State Offices Division.</seg>
<seg id="28">The auditee was the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter „MO").</seg>
<seg id="29">The audited period covered 2001, 2002 and 2003 (hereinafter „period under scrutiny").</seg>
<seg id="30">In some cases, the joint report also contains statistics from earlier periods.</seg>
<seg id="31">2. Recapitulation of the audit results</seg>
<seg id="32">2.1. Assessment of the audit work</seg>
<seg id="33">The parallel audits covered the following areas: - The asylum process, - Refugee facilities, - Management of finances and state property, - The internal control system.</seg>
<seg id="34">Experience and information exchange between the Supreme Audit Office Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place during the preparation and execution of the audits.</seg>
<seg id="35">This exchange made it possible to evaluate the submitted materials more rigorously and to analyse the reasons for the differences found in the way the asylum process is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="36">That made it possible to concentrate on the key problems that influence the work of refugee facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ultimately, it had a positive effect on the quality of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="38">2.2 Summary of the audit results</seg>
<seg id="39">The harmonisation of asylum law in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union legislation was one issue covered by the assessment reports of the European commission on the two countries' readiness to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="40">The enactment of legislation on this matter continues even after both countries have joined the EU, with the goal of further harmonisation with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="41">In 2001 the number of applicants seeking asylum in the Czech Republic rose sharply.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the Slovak Republic the number of applicants has been growing constantly, with a major increase occurring in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="43">Within the meaning of international treaties the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material assistance to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="44">The necessary finances for this purpose are earmarked in the state budgets of both countries.</seg>
<seg id="45">The size of expenditure drawn from the state budgets in both countries is chiefly influenced by the number of applicants, the length of asylum proceedings leading to the award or non-award of asylum and the state of health of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="46">The magnitude of certain selected benefits in the two countries is comparable.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have established refugee facilities, in which they have gradually put in place suitable conditions for housing participants in asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Throughout applicants' stay in the refugee facilities they are provided with accommodation, food, healthcare and basic material items and hygiene articles.</seg>
<seg id="49">A, the same time, leisure-time educational courses are organised and applicants are given access to cultural and sporting activities.</seg>
<seg id="50">Refugee facilities include reception centres and residential centres; the Czech Republic also has integration refugee centres.</seg>
<seg id="51">The cost of one day spent in a facility depends on occupancy levels and the standard of fittings in the centre. Costs in the two countries are comparable.</seg>
<seg id="52">The capacity of refugee facilities in the Czech Republic has essentially been stabilised.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the Slovak Republic it is envisioned that capacity will be increased by almost 1000 extra places in the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="54">The aim is to put in place suitable conditions for the expected increase in the number of applicants in the coming years in consequence of the Dublin Convention.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the Czech Republic, most of the approved budgetary expenditure went towards the provision of services, mostly expenditure on providing accommodation and food for applicants in refugee facilities operated on a contractual basis, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of having a full-time security service guarding the refugee facilities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Spending on pay, payments for work done and insurance was also significant.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the Slovak Republic, budgetary management regarding the implementation of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by a large quantity of budgetary measures adopted in response to justified requirements related to the increasing number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">The spending of current expenditures consisted mainly in wages, salaries and insurance expenditures, material and service costs, as well as security service costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">The results of the audits in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic drew attention to certain similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental influence of financial management and the use of state property.</seg>
<seg id="60">These mainly concerned the use of state budget finances contrary to the purpose defined by the state budget act, where investment in the technical amelioration of long-term tangible assets was paid for out of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="61">Stocktaking errors and non-compliance with the chart of accounts also constituted breaches of the accounting act.</seg>
<seg id="62">Further minor shortcomings were found in the management of state property in the Czech Republic, whereby it was let to another party without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="63">Failing to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to data in the real estate register constituted a breach of the act on the real estate register; the act on refuse was violated when a party that was not authorised to manage waste was contracted to dispose of refuse.</seg>
<seg id="64">Shortcomings were found in the Slovak Republic in the provision of inordinately high advance payments for the supply of electricity and natural gas, in public procurement and in the management of state property, where property records were insufficient and the manner in which surplus property was disposed of was not proved.</seg>
<seg id="65">The internal control system in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic was applied within the meaning of the binding legislation governing the performance of financial control.</seg>
<seg id="66">No shortcomings were found in the submitted written documentation.</seg>
<seg id="67">Despite the identified shortcomings, the supreme audit office Czech Republic and the supreme audit office of the Slovak Republic rate positively the procedure followed by the RFA and the MO in providing services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the audit findings the Supreme Audit Office Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic state that despite the pronounced increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years the relevant organisational units of both countries have handled the tasks associated with caring for asylum seekers satisfactorily.</seg>
<seg id="69">The assessment shows that the system is functional and stable.</seg>
<seg id="70">The audit results were discussed with the statutory representatives of the concerned organisational units of the state both in the Czech and Slovak Republic.</seg>
<seg id="71">Based on the results of the audit we recommend making use of the positive methodological experiences gained from the audit in further joint audits as part of international cooperation between supreme audit institutions.</seg>
<seg id="72">3. Legislative framework</seg>
<seg id="73">In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (The Treaty on the Legal Status of Refugees and the New York Protocol of 1967).</seg>
<seg id="74">The first legislation was implemented by Act no. 498/1990 Coll., on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="75">Since 1.1.2000 Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum and amending Act no. 283/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been in force in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="76">This Act has been amended five times in total (by Acts nos. 2/2002 Coll., 217/2002 Coll., 320/2002 Coll., 519/2002 Coll., and 222/2003 Coll.).</seg>
<seg id="77">Two more amendments of Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, are in the legislative pipeline and the adoption of new amendments will be tied to European legislation.</seg>
<seg id="78">When Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, was being drawn up, asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and documents covering asylum were political documents.</seg>
<seg id="79">The endeavour in enacting this law was to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.</seg>
<seg id="80">The shifting of asylum from the 3rd to the 1 st pillar was an important change for asylum policy in the EU - asylum law became part of community law on 1.5.1999 when the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force.</seg>
<seg id="81">This shift made it necessary to create suitable legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments of suitable binding force.</seg>
<seg id="82">The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU law has been covered by many assessment reports of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="83">Key community regulations governing asylum were adopted shortly before or even after the Czech Republic joined the EU and the deadline for their transposition had not yet elapsed at the time of the audit by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="84">Once they are incorporated into Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to report to the European Commission on how it effected the transposition.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the Slovak Republic the procedure to be followed by the state authorities in proceedings to award refugee status for and determine the duties of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been provided with temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was laid down, with effect from 1.1.1996, by Act of the National Assembly of the Slovak Republic no. 283/1005 Coll., on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since 2003 the act on refugees has been superseded by Act no. 480/2002 Coll., on asylum and amending certain acts, in which Slovak law was harmonised with Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20.7.2001, on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof.</seg>
<seg id="87">After two amendments of Act no. 480/2002 Coll., on asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was passed at the beginning of 2005. This third amendment represents further harmonisation of Slovak law with EU legislation on migration and asylum.</seg>
<seg id="88">The duty for asylum seekers to visit a Slovak language introductory course during their stay in an integration centre, the appointment of court guardians for foreign minors staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, making it possible for applicants to enter into employment under certain defined circumstances are all significant features of the amendment.</seg>
<seg id="89">The harmonisation of Slovak law with EU law on migration and the asylum process has been appraised in the European Commission's regular reports on readiness of the Slovak Republic to join the EU.</seg>
<seg id="90">In 2002 the report drew attention to the MO's insufficient staffing in the light of the increased number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="91">4. Asylum process</seg>
<seg id="92">In the Czech Republic matters concerning refugees have come under the remit of the Mol since 1990.</seg>
<seg id="93">With effect from 1.1.1996 the Mol set up the RFA in order to separate the exercise of stale administration in the asylum procedure, which is exercised via the Asylum and Migration Policy Department (AMPD) of the Mol, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="94">The RFA's task is to handle, on behalf of the Mol, the provision of accommodation, catering, healthcare and other services to participants in asylum proceedings and those granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the Slovak Republic the key tasks in the asylum process are carried out by the MO with particular regard to the financing of and material provision for the asylum process in the scope set out by special regulations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Priority tasks are matters related to decision-making on foreigners' asylum applications in the first stage of administrative proceedings and the comprehensive operation of refugee facilities in terms of accommodation, food, healthcare and financial and material provision for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, it prepares the concept of the state's migration policy.</seg>
<seg id="98">The results achieved in the creation of an asylum system in the Slovak Republic in past years have been markedly influenced by its cooperation with and support from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees („UNHCR").</seg>
<seg id="99">One particular benefit was the office's financial involvement in renovating housing stock for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="100">The UNHCR has also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="101">4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and results of the asylum process</seg>
<seg id="102">The following graph shows how the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic has developed.</seg>
<seg id="103">There was a particularly pronounced increase in 2001 as a result of the Kosovo crisis; in 2003 there was an increased number of refugees from Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="104">Table 1 gives an overview of the results of asylum proceedings in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the period under scrutiny asylum was awarded in a total of 394 cases; 83 of these were in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="106">Asylum was not awarded in 22 731 cases in the period under scrutiny; in 22 636 cases asylum proceedings were suspended.</seg>
<seg id="107">The number of participants in proceedings as at 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been issued with a decision and those who have not yet received an issued decision.</seg>
<seg id="108">It also includes persons who have been excused for missing the deadline for appeals or for whom a prior decision was annulled and no new decision has yet been issued.</seg>
<seg id="109">In the Slovak Republic the number of asylum seekers has been constantly on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="110">If there were 96 asylum seekers registered in 1993, by 2003 the figure had climbed to 10 358.</seg>
<seg id="111">There was a considerable increase in the number of applicants in 2001, with 8 131 new applicants registered, a rise of 423% compared to 2000, in which there were 1 556 applications for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="112">Table 2 gives details of the results of asylum proceedings in Slovak Republic in the period under scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="113">Asylum was granted 49 times in total in the period under scrutiny; the number in individual years did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="114">Asylum was refused in 860 cases.</seg>
<seg id="115">Asylum proceedings were suspended in a total 23 088 cases.</seg>
<seg id="116">The majority of applicants voluntarily abandoned asylum proceedings before their conclusion by leaving asylum facilities without permission.</seg>
<seg id="117">That accounted for over 82% of the total number of registered applicants in 2002 and over 94% in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="118">The average length of stay in asylum facilities per applicant was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="119">The information of MO also reveals that most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic were economic migrants, who are not protected by the international treaties that the Slovak Republic signed up to.</seg>
<seg id="120">These applicants are abusing the asylum system.</seg>
<seg id="121">Applications for asylum based on economic reasons such as looking for a job or better living conditions are not grounds for granting asylum.</seg>
<seg id="122">Under Section 12 (1) (a) of Act no. 480/2002 Coll., on asylum, such an application should be adjudged evidently groundless and should be ruled on within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="123">There are at present no internationally recognised principles for identifying economic migrants that would distinguish them from asylum seekers escaping persecution in their country of origin and that would speed up the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="124">In view of the above, it is fair to say that the Slovak Republic is a transit country for international migration; western European states continue to be the migrants' ultimate destination.</seg>
<seg id="125">After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Dublin Convention attributing responsibility for assessing asylum applications submitted in one of the European Community member states.</seg>
<seg id="126">The Convention prevents the submission of multiple applications for asylum in more than one EU state.</seg>
<seg id="127">After positive identification in the EURODAC system applicants return to the country in which they first registered.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Slovak Republic lies on the EU's outer borders; that means that application of the Dublin Convention may in the coming years result in an increase in the number of applicants, who require conditions enabling them to stay in Slovak Republic until the asylum decision is issued.</seg>
<seg id="129">4.2 Spending of financial means</seg>
<seg id="130">Within the meaning of international treaties and national legislation based thereon, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="131">The state budgets of both countries set aside the necessary finances for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="132">The amount of money drawn from the state budget is influenced chiefly by the number of applicants, the length of asylum proceedings up to the official decision on the award of asylum and by applicants' state of health.</seg>
<seg id="133">The growing number of persons entering the asylum process has a direct impact on increased spending of legally defined benefits for applicants, such as food expenses, pocket money, the expense of basic material provision, other material provision and other social allowances.</seg>
<seg id="134">The magnitude of certain selected benefits is comparable in the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="135">In the Czech Republic in the period under scrutiny, food allowance was CZK 58 per person per day, pocket money CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 for a child up to the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="136">The average cost of keeping one asylum seeker in a facility for one day was CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="137">Besides pocket money, asylum seekers accommodated in private outside refugee facilities may receive an allowance up to the subsistence minimum.</seg>
<seg id="138">Section 84 of Ac, no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as amended, awards municipalities the entitlement to an allowance to cover costs associated with refugee facilities in their territory.</seg>
<seg id="139">The size of the allowance is fixed every year by government resolution, and amounted to CZK 7 per person per day of stay in the period under scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="140">At the same time, municipalities are entitled to an allowance to cover non-investment costs of elementary schools attended by asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="141">The size of the allowance in the period under scrutiny was CZK 120 for every school-going asylum seeker on the condition that the person in question attended school for at least 10 days in the given month.</seg>
<seg id="142">In the Slovak Republic food allowance was SKK 70 per person per day in the period under scrutiny; pocket money was SKK 12 per person per day and SKK 8 for a child aged up to 15.</seg>
<seg id="143">The average cost of housing one asylum seeker in an refugee facility per day was SKK 442 in 2001, SKK 447 in 2002 and SKK 445 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="144">Under Act no. 480/2002 Coll. (SR), on asylum, municipalities with refugee facilities in their territory receive an allowance to cover part of the municipality's expenditure associated with establishing and running an refugee facility.</seg>
<seg id="145">So far municipalities have only made partial use of the possibility of applying for the allowance, which is fixed at SKK 1 500 per bed per calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="146">The national legislation in both countries lays down a 90-day deadline, from the start of asylum proceedings, in which a decision must be issued. In warranted cases this deadline may be extended.</seg>
<seg id="147">The most common reason for asylum proceedings overstepping this deadline, which has an influence on state budget expenditure, is appeals lodged against rulings not to award asylum.</seg>
<seg id="148">In the Czech Republic most official decisions are issued after a period of 90 to 180 days (31.54%).</seg>
<seg id="149">The second greatest number of decisions is issued 90 days or less after the asylum application was lodged (17.61 %).</seg>
<seg id="150">In total, 73% of asylum proceedings opened in 2001-2003 were officially ruled on a year or less after proceedings commenced.</seg>
<seg id="151">92% of applications were officially ruled on two years of less after the start of proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="152">In the Slovak Republic up to 90% of applicants not awarded asylum make use of their legal right to extend the deadline by lodging an appeal with a court, according to the MO SR.</seg>
<seg id="153">In some cases the deadline was extended by over a year and court proceedings had no, been brought to a conclusion at the time of the audit.</seg>
<seg id="154">The establishment of joint offices of the MO and the Frontier and Foreigners' Police Office of the Police Force in reception centres a, Adamov-Gbely, Opatovská Nová Ves and Liptovské Vlachy, which occurred during the audit on 1.10.2004, is expected to speed up asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="155">This move is expected to simplify procedures and cut the amount of time taken by proceedings between the two components of the asylum process.</seg>
<seg id="156">5. Refugee facilities</seg>
<seg id="157">The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have established refugee facilities, in which they have, over time, put in place suitable conditions for providing services to the participants in asylum proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="158">During asylum seekers' stays in refugee facilities they receive accommodation, food, healthcare, pocket money and basic material items and hygiene articles.</seg>
<seg id="159">Leisure-time educational courses are organised and applicants are given access to cultural and sporting activities.</seg>
<seg id="160">5.1 Refugee facilities in the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="161">The RFA administers and operates refugee facilities and is responsible for managing state property in the complex is of the reception centre at Vysní Lhota, the Červený Újezd reception and residential centre, the residential centres at Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí and Havířov, and the integration refugee centres at Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.</seg>
<seg id="162">At the start of 2002 a reception centre was set up in the transit area of Prague Ruzyně Airport.</seg>
<seg id="163">The RFA is also responsible for the operation of refugee facilities at Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal entity under Section 60 (3) of Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum.</seg>
<seg id="164">The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 places and the total residential capacity of reception centres is 1 977 places.</seg>
<seg id="165">Reception centres are closed facilities, which asylum seekers may not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception actions set out in Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="166">Violating the duty to remain in the reception centre is treated as a misdemeanour.</seg>
<seg id="167">Residential centres, to which asylum seekers are sent from reception centres, serve to accommodate asylum seekers until the decision on their asylum application takes force in law.</seg>
<seg id="168">If certain conditions are satisfied, asylum seekers may leave the residential centres, or possibly live in private accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="169">At the reception and residential centres where they are registered, asylum seekers are entitled to free accommodation, food, other services and pocket money on condition that they undergo the actions necessary to ascertain their financial and property means and provided that these means are such that it would be wrongful to demand even partial payment for the set services.</seg>
<seg id="170">Integration refugee centres are used for the temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="171">Clients are put up in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for six months but include the option of extending them up to such time as it is possible to find suitable housing for them or they find their own housing under the state integration programme.</seg>
<seg id="172">In integration refugee centres clients pay all the costs of accommodation and provide themselves with food on individual basis.</seg>
<seg id="173">Persons awarded the status of refugee have the same rights and duties as Czech citizens and the same access to social insurance.</seg>
<seg id="174">5.1.1 Cost of refugee facilities</seg>
<seg id="175">The cost of putting up one person for one day was chosen as the best indicator for comparing refugee facilities.</seg>
<seg id="176">This indicator is based on the actual number of persons who are actually provided with services by an refugee facility every day.</seg>
<seg id="177">In Table 3 and the graph facilities run by the RFA are referred to as „own" and facilities run by legal entities under Section 80 of Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as „contractual".</seg>
<seg id="178">The cost of one day of stay in an own refugee facility run by the RFA falls as occupancy of the facility rises, as the fixed costs of running facilities are spread over more asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="179">The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers increases proportionately with their increasing number.</seg>
<seg id="180">In 2001 and 2003 occupancy levels at the RFA's own refugee facilities reached crisis levels.</seg>
<seg id="181">At times in 2003 an extraordinary accommodation capacity in the form of residential containers (320 beds) was even used to cope with a capacity crisis in refugee facilities caused by the mass influx of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="182">Leasing of 80 residential and six sanitary containers secured this capacity.</seg>
<seg id="183">Expenditure on one applicant per day of stay was then lower in these years.</seg>
<seg id="184">However, it is not possible to maintain high occupancy levels at these facilities in the long term:</seg>
<seg id="185">the risk of an unexpected influx of refugees, and the related demands for increased accommodation capacity, must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="186">At the same time, when facilities are fully occupied it is not possible to perform certain repairs, maintenance work and investment.</seg>
<seg id="187">Having contractually run refugee facilities makes it possible to respond flexibly to capacity requirements when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="188">5.2 Refugee facilities in the Slovak Republic</seg>
<seg id="189">Refugee facilities in Slovak Republic comprise reception centres and residential centres.</seg>
<seg id="190">The MO administers reception centres at Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the Brezová pod Bradlom residential centre.</seg>
<seg id="191">The reception centres' total capacity is 470 places; the residential centre has 100 places.</seg>
<seg id="192">The MO responded to the growing number of asylum seekers by setting up a residential centre at Gabčíkovo in spaces leased from the Slovak Technical University in Bratislava, with a flexible available capacity of 250 to 940 places.</seg>
<seg id="193">Under the contract the leaser also provides services associated with operation of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="194">In this way the MO solved the problem of its own staff shortage.</seg>
<seg id="195">A residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in leased premises at Jaziercie with a capacity of 160 places.</seg>
<seg id="196">In the period under scrutiny, the occupancy rate of reception centres was on average from 57% to 62%; average occupancy in residential centres ranged from 33% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="197">Occupancy rates changed according to season, but the highest rates were in the last months of the year, when many more applicants applied for asylum than in the other months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Once the centres at Opatovská Nová Ves and Vlachy are refurbished they will offer a further 450 places.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of places available will rise by a further 550 when the centre at Humenné is completed.</seg>
<seg id="200">5.2.1 Cost of refugee facilities</seg>
<seg id="201">Data on the cost of running refugee facilities are given in Table 4.</seg>
<seg id="202">Analysis of the data reveals that refugee facilities operated by a third party providing premises and managing the working of the facility, including all the associated activities, is one way of handling the tasks relating to accommodating asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic at a reasonable cost.</seg>
<seg id="203">6. Management of finances and state property</seg>
<seg id="204">6.1 Analysis of financial management</seg>
<seg id="205">In 2001 in the Czech Republic, the RFA's approved budgetary expenditure was raised by thirteen budget measures by CZK 103 077 000.</seg>
<seg id="206">Of this, CZK 89 979 000 (87.29%) were purpose-tied funds, mostly for responding to the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44 538 000) and providing healthcare to asylum seekers (CZK 38 870 000).</seg>
<seg id="207">In 2002 the RFA's expenditure was raised by twenty budget measures by CZK 88 362 000.</seg>
<seg id="208">Of this, CZK 62,282,000 (70.48%) were purpose-tied funds, most of which (CZK 53 200 000) was for providing healthcare to asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="209">In 2003 the RFA's expenditure was raised by a total of CZK 88 078 000 by fourteen budget measures.</seg>
<seg id="210">CZK 82 000 000 of this (93.09%) were purpose-tied funds released from the General Treasury Administration.</seg>
<seg id="211">CZK 51 000 000 was earmarked for healthcare provided to asylum seekers; CZK 24 000 000 for responding to the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7 000 000 for the programme of humanitarian airlifts of the handicapped from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="212">Table 5 shows selected items in the RFA's spending in the period under scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="213">The table shows clearly that most spending went on the provision of services.</seg>
<seg id="214">Expenditure on services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="215">Most expenditure on services was accounted for by expenditure on accommodation and food provision to the applicants of refugee facilities operated under contract, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of having a constant security service guarding each refugee facility.</seg>
<seg id="216">Spending on wages, salaries and insurance accounted for a considerable part of the RFA's total expenditure (23.99% - 24.97%).</seg>
<seg id="217">Last but not least, purchases of material were another significant part of the RFA's total expenditure, with spending on foodstuffs the biggest individual item (7.61 % - 9.83% of total expenditure).</seg>
<seg id="218">In the Slovak Republic the MO's budget management of funds to cover migration policy and the asylum process was marked by several budget measures that responded to justified demands related to the increasing number of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="219">In 2001 and 2002 in particular, proposed budgetary expenditure displayed an imbalance between the MO's demands, which were based on the increasing number of asylum seekers and the need to finance their statutory entitlements, and the provided resources, primarily in the main category of current expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="220">The administrator of the budget chapter resolved the imbalance by means of several budget measures in the course of the year, which increased the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by as much as 71.7% in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="221">Outline of selected MO expenditures in the period under scrutiny is given in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="222">Spending on wages, salaries and insurance formed a major part of current expenditure, ranging from 24.47% to 30.51% of total expenditure, and spending on material and services, ranging from 21.04% to 38.82%.</seg>
<seg id="223">The cost of security services accounted for more than 10% and purchases of foodstuffs 3.92% to 7.20%.</seg>
<seg id="224">Spending on accommodation and catering services took up another major portion of expenditure, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.</seg>
<seg id="225">Capital expenditure is a relatively minor item, accounting for 1.03% to 6.25% of total expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="226">6.2 Identified shortcomings</seg>
<seg id="227">The results of the audits in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted certain similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental influence on the management of finances and state property.</seg>
<seg id="228">The following were the main shortcomings: a) Using state budget finances contrary to the purpose for which they were defined in the state budget act, where investments constituting technical amelioration of long-term fixed assets were paid for out of current expenditure; b) Breaches of the act on accounting regarding stocktaking and non-compliance with the chart of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="229">In the Czech Republic minor shortcomings were identified in the use of state property, where a third party was allowed to use state property without the necessary contract; failure to abide by the deadline for reporting changes to database in the real estate register constituted a breach of the act on the real estate register; assigning refuse disposal to a party not authorised to do so constituted a breach of the act on refuse.</seg>
<seg id="230">In the Slovak Republic shortcomings were found in the provision of inordinately high advance payments for supply of electricity and natural gas; shortcomings in public documents and in management of state property, where insufficient records were kept and the means of disposal of surplus property was not proved.</seg>
<seg id="231">7. Internal control system</seg>
<seg id="232">In the Czech Republic an internal control system was established in the RFA on 1.7.2002 within the meaning of Act no. 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, setting out the powers of individual employees responsible for the performance of ex ante, interim and ex post control.</seg>
<seg id="233">At the same time, a system of internal audit was introduced and an internal auditor for the RFA was appointed.</seg>
<seg id="234">Every year the RFA issues the plan of financial, social and operational controls, the purpose of which is to scrutinise the management of finances and state property in individual refugee facilities administered by the RFA.</seg>
<seg id="235">42 controls were performed in 2002 and 54 in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="236">In the Slovak Republic direct control of compliance with the law and internal regulations in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic is performed by the Control Office of the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="237">No control of the performance of tasks in the area of asylum policy was performed in the period under scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="238">The MO's internal control system is mainly designed to carry out ex ante and interim financial control pursuant to Act no. 502/2001 Coll. (SR), on financial control and internal audit.</seg>
<seg id="239">The performance of financial control is also governed by internal regulations of the director of the MO.</seg>
<seg id="240">Substantive control, as part of the management of individual units, was specified in the annual plan of the MO.</seg>
<seg id="241">Department directors were made responsible for the performance of control in this area.</seg>
<seg id="242">According to the submitted written documentation no shortcomings were detected.</seg>
<seg id="243">Since Regulation of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic no. 28 of 23.4.2004 took effect, the MO has been obliged to deal with and investigate complaints according to the act on complaints.</seg>
<seg id="244">In the immediate future it will be necessary to finalise how this task will be organised and dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="245">Communique</seg>
<seg id="246">The present report has been executed in Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office and the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Democratic leaders have bottled up President Bush's capital-gains tax cut in the Senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id="2">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said he intends to use Senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least 60 votes before they can address the issue.</seg>
<seg id="3">And neither Democrats nor Republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The 60-vote requirement will be there and they don't have the 60 votes," Sen. Mitchell said. "They don't have the votes to get it passed."</seg>
<seg id="5">Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the leading Republican proponent of the tax cut, didn't disagree. "I'm not sure what's going to happen," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Previously he had said he would be able to find the requisite 60 votes eventually.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sen. Packwood has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill, now pending in the Senate, that would authorize aid to Poland and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="8">Democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster, or extended debate.</seg>
<seg id="9">For a cloture vote to stop the filibuster, Republicans must muster at least 60 votes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yesterday, Sen. Packwood acknowledged, "We don't have the votes for cloture today."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Republicans show no sign of relenting.</seg>
<seg id="12">GOP leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the Eastern Europe aid measure.</seg>
<seg id="13">And they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the Senate with the capital-gains provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is serious business; we're serious about a capital-gains reduction," said Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, the Senate's Republican leader. "The strategy is `Let's vote. ' "</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans contend that they can garner a majority in the 100-member Senate for a capital-gains tax cut.</seg>
<seg id="16">They accuse the Democrats of unfairly using Senate rules to erect a 60-vote hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Democrats counter that the Republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the Packwood plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">Democrats asserted that the proposal, which also would create a new type of individual retirement account, was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose billions of dollars in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="20">Republicans countered that long-range revenue estimates were unreliable.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held.</seg>
<seg id="22">It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition.</seg>
<seg id="23">A White House spokesman said President Bush is "generally supportive" of the Packwood plan.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel</seg>
<seg id="2">It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.</seg>
<seg id="3">From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.</seg>
<seg id="8">He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.</seg>

<seg id="1">That Was Really Bad Body Language</seg>
<seg id="2">President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't do it."</seg>
<seg id="7">Remember?</seg>
<seg id="8">Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?</seg>
<seg id="9">Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?</seg>
<seg id="10">Oh, no.</seg>
<seg id="11">I didn't leak."</seg>
<seg id="12">Well, wait one minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."</seg>
<seg id="17">But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="19">Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee</seg>
<seg id="3">Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.</seg>
<seg id="6">Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="10">In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.</seg>
<seg id="12">The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.</seg>

<seg id="1">a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves.</seg>
<seg id="2">In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them.</seg>
<seg id="3">It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the narrator Stevens, the solitary butler of Darlington Hall, mulls over such hallowed terms as "greatness," "dignity," "service" and "loyalty," we see how pious cant subverts the soul.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stevens's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve.</seg>
<seg id="6">Such armor crushes the soldier.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mask cuts to the quick.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's 1956, the year the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire.</seg>
<seg id="9">As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall, where a former housekeeper resides, perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage, perhaps (he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge) not disinclined to return to domestic service, Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we're reading:</seg>
<seg id="10">"We call this land of ours Great Britain, and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective. . . . It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart.</seg>
<seg id="12">What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, of its own greatness, and feels no need to shout it.</seg>
<seg id="14">In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness."</seg>
<seg id="15">An effusive landscape?</seg>
<seg id="16">An ill-mannered mountain?</seg>
<seg id="17">But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner (his conscious efforts at "banter" always fail -- most comically): "This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years: what is a `great' butler?" His answer is one "possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position." Such dignity "has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits." He "will not be shaken out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. . . . Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of."</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling; one's pantry is "not unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port: "Please don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="19">You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare: "For all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph." We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow.</seg>
<seg id="20">That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Ishiguro's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, "An Artist of the Floating World," set in Japan after the war.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster.</seg>
<seg id="23">With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti-Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: "It is, in practice, simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service. . . . `This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable.</seg>
<seg id="24">I will hereafter devote myself to serving him. ' This is loyalty intelligently bestowed."</seg>
<seg id="25">In the end, after meeting with the former housekeeper, Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk, thinking of her and of his employer, and declares "I trusted.</seg>
<seg id="26">I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. . . . I can't even say I made my own mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Really -- one has to ask oneself -- what dignity is there in that?" The loyal servant has come full circle.</seg>
<seg id="28">What is greatness?</seg>
<seg id="29">What is dignity?</seg>
<seg id="30">We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective: The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk.</seg>
<seg id="31">But as "The Remains of the Day" so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity, such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art.</seg>

<seg id="4">The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3, alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unusual seaborne meeting won't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer, at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In announcing the meeting yesterday, Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any "substantial decisions or agreements." Instead, he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get "better acquainted" and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations, the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics, whose support he needs.</seg>
<seg id="10">For his part, Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="11">A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism, though it will hardly eliminate it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush's handling of the Soviet relationship, praised the president for arranging the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he added: "The mere fact of a meeting doesn't deal with the substance of policy."</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Bush said that the December meeting, which was announced simultaneously in Moscow, will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the "fanfare" and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers. "By doing it in this manner we can have, I would say, more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances, things of that nature for public consumption," Mr. Bush said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, at a news conference in Moscow, said, "As the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year, they found it useful, I would say even necessary, to hold an interim informal meeting." Although no specific agreements are expected, Mr. Shevardnadze said "that doesn't mean they will be without an agenda."</seg>
<seg id="16">If the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level U.S.-Soviet meetings, their talks would include human rights, Soviet reforms, regional disputes, relations with allies, economic cooperation, arms control, and joint efforts to fight narcotics, terrorism and pollution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade.</seg>
<seg id="19">He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S., possibly at the 1990 summit.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Soviets hope a trade agreement would give them Most-Favored Nation status, which would lower the tariffs on Soviet exports to the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="21">In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005.</seg>
<seg id="22">Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits.</seg>
<seg id="23">But one Bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the Soviet economy or other issues.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Don't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation, or arms control, or the environment," he said. "Those things will all come up, but in a fairly informal way."</seg>
<seg id="25">Instead, this official said, "This is vintage George Bush.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was George Bush's own idea.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly."</seg>
<seg id="28">Aside from the Soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms, one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions.</seg>
<seg id="29">Western analysts say that, given the meeting's setting at sea, Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.</seg>
<seg id="30">That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year.</seg>
<seg id="31">They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington's area of greatest superiority.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering, former President Reagan's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland.</seg>
<seg id="33">That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr. Bush said that he initiated talks with the Soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to Mr. Gorbachev last July, which the Soviet leader readily accepted.</seg>
<seg id="35">But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides, and word of it didn't reach many second-level officials until the past few days.</seg>
<seg id="36">Indeed, many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that Mr. Bush wasn't interested in such an informal get-together.</seg>
<seg id="37">Though President Bush's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev, it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting.</seg>
<seg id="38">Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary, who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe, a senior aide said.</seg>
<seg id="39">While flying home from those discussions, Mr. Bush drafted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal get-together to precede their formal summit next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided, under pressure from their leaders, not to offer their own proposal, placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush's legislative priority.</seg>
<seg id="2">A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan was complete except for finishing touches, and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut, called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist.</seg>
<seg id="6">Afterward, leaders of the dissident Democrats relented, and said they wouldn't offer their own proposal as they had planned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision is a setback for President Bush, who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="9">Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder.</seg>
<seg id="10">Still, Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment, predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Sen. Mitchell, buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats, strongly disagreed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president's initiative would fail this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yesterday, in an interview, he added that the Democrats' decision "increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year." Mr. Mitchell's first victory came last week, when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that didn't contain a capital-gains provision.</seg>
<seg id="15">That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill, now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="16">The House version of the bill does include the tax cut.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill, perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation.</seg>
<seg id="18">To help lay the groundwork for that fight, President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The president apparently will have only one bill to push, Sen. Packwood's, and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it. "I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor," said Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), a leader of those Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Packwood plan, as expected, would allow individuals to exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held, until it reached a maximum of 35% after seven years.</seg>
<seg id="22">The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1.</seg>
<seg id="23">As an alternative, taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index.</seg>
<seg id="24">For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.</seg>
<seg id="25">That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Packwood plan also would include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home, education expenses and medical expenses.</seg>
<seg id="28">Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs, but would be subject to tax though no penalty.</seg>

<seg id="1">It can be hoped that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="2">A strong challenge from the far left, the Communist coalition Izquierda Unida, failed to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="3">He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left.</seg>
<seg id="4">If he follows the correct path, he may be able to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them.</seg>
<seg id="6">It could point to plenty of ailments that the Spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unemployment still is officially recorded at 16.5%, the highest rate in Europe, although actual joblessness may be lower.</seg>
<seg id="8">Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system, schools, mail service, telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Large pockets of poverty still exist.</seg>
<seg id="10">The left also is critical of the style of the Socialist government -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Gonzalez and his colleagues, particularly the finance minister, Carlos Solchaga, are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television (controlled by the state) to face their accusers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In response to this, the Socialist prime minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are very considerable: Since 1986, when Spain joined the European Community, its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6% -- the fastest in the EC.</seg>
<seg id="14">In that time more than 1.2 million jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below 17% from 21%.</seg>
<seg id="15">A 14% inflation rate dropped below 5%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $12.5 billion, about double the year-earlier rate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Gonzalez also has split with the left in reaffirming Spain's NATO commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary, however.</seg>
<seg id="19">He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the best the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- nearly 40% -- from endorsing the direction Spain is taking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Now he can go further.</seg>
<seg id="22">He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income, in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher, not lower, revenues.</seg>
<seg id="23">He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers, thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years.</seg>
<seg id="24">The voters delivered Mr. Gonzalez a third mandate for his successes.</seg>
<seg id="25">They, as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the Spanish model, are supporting the direction Spain is taking.</seg>
<seg id="26">It would be sad for Mr. Gonzalez to abandon them to appease his foes.</seg>

<seg id="2">The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.</seg>
<seg id="4">The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.</seg>
<seg id="6">Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.</seg>
<seg id="9">What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.</seg>
<seg id="12">American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.</seg>
<seg id="17">Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.</seg>

<seg id="1">Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive</seg>
<seg id="2">The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.</seg>
<seg id="4">He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .</seg>
<seg id="6">When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.</seg>
<seg id="8">When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."</seg>
<seg id="9">Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He erased her from his life," Hale said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.</seg>

<seg id="2">NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text</seg>
<seg id="3">A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."</seg>
<seg id="4">The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="6">"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.</seg>
<seg id="8">After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="12">The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.</seg>
<seg id="13">"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.</seg>
<seg id="14">She's not a racist.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.</seg>
<seg id="16">"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?</seg>
<seg id="17">Your newborn baby?</seg>
<seg id="18">Come on."</seg>
<seg id="19">Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You're going to go after someone like that?</seg>
<seg id="21">That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.</seg>
<seg id="22">While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.</seg>

<seg id="1">President Bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs.</seg>
<seg id="2">He wants it now.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not so fast, says Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, a fellow Republican. "I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century," he says.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's the line-item veto, a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by Congress without vetoing the entire bill.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whatever one thinks of the idea, it's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rather, it's a device that could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress, fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business.</seg>
<seg id="7">President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress -- which hasn't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks.</seg>
<seg id="9">White House spokesmen last week said Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power, exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington, it would set off a political earthquake. "The ramifications are enormous," says Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat who is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. "It's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to Congress."</seg>
<seg id="11">White House aides know it's a step that can't be taken lightly -- and for that reason, the president may back down from launching a test case this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming, Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress.</seg>
<seg id="13">They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto.</seg>
<seg id="15">The issue arose last week when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case.</seg>
<seg id="16">White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea, but cautioned that there wasn't a firm decision to try it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Bush, former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process.</seg>
<seg id="18">They maintain that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets.</seg>
<seg id="21">More provocatively, some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush doesn't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="22">They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution that states: "Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him or . . . disapproved by him. . . ."</seg>
<seg id="23">This clause, they argue, is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a "bill," and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills.</seg>
<seg id="24">Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.), for one, accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush "to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional."</seg>
<seg id="25">There's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court -- and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved. "It's a major issue, and they wouldn't want to leave it at a lower level," says Stephen Glazier, a New York attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rep. Edwards, the California Democrat, is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge Mr. Bush in the courts, arguing a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything the framers of the Constitution had in mind. "It puts this president in the legislative business," he declares. "That's not what our fathers had in mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in Congress, Rep. Edwards argues, a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers.</seg>
<seg id="28">He notes that, as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area, he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system.</seg>
<seg id="29">If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative, Rep. Edwards says, the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman "shapes up" on the foreign-policy issue.</seg>
<seg id="30">Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst it would cause, it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected.</seg>
<seg id="33">Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity.</seg>
<seg id="34">And it isn't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves.</seg>
<seg id="35">Still, proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important "chilling effect" on all manner of appropriations bills.</seg>
<seg id="36">Lawmakers, they say, would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later.</seg>
<seg id="37">Whatever the outcome of a test case, President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would "antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans," says Louis Fisher, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who specializes in executive-legislative relations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in "the way the system works," he notes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Indeed, although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto, some, ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed.</seg>
<seg id="40">Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person.</seg>
<seg id="41">Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now, he notes, may regret it later: "Sometime, you're going to have a Democratic president again" who'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill."</seg>

<seg id="2">"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.</seg>
<seg id="3">Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?</seg>
<seg id="4">Their reluctance is all due to timing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.</seg>
<seg id="6">George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.</seg>
<seg id="7">What happens after the FBI produces its report?</seg>
<seg id="8">There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="2">The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pyongyang has made no public comments.</seg>
<seg id="6">The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="7">Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.</seg>
<seg id="9">China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican, but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush's economic policy-making.</seg>
<seg id="2">"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that have to be the subject of major initiatives," he said in an interview. "I'd like to see that initiative, and I haven't.</seg>
<seg id="3">There isn't a big shot, an agenda."</seg>
<seg id="4">A few hours later, the stock market dropped 190 points.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame, although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street's woes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr. Butcher's comments make one thing clear: Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Consider this:</seg>
<seg id="8">-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight, President Bush must order $16 billion of automatic, across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill. "We simply don't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices," House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) said yesterday on NBC News's "Meet the Press."</seg>
<seg id="10">-- For the last two weeks, the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower; the Fed has been resisting. "One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board," said Lawrence Kudlow, a Bear, Stearns & Co. economist, on ABC's "This Week."</seg>
<seg id="12">-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last month, Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines, which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC.</seg>
<seg id="16">Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop.</seg>
<seg id="17">In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="20">And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous.</seg>
<seg id="21">The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit, resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $12 billion during that period.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, barring further drops in the market this week, a similar outcome doesn't seem likely this year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday's drop, by itself, isn't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring's gimmick-ridden plan, which still isn't fully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="24">One of the biggest reasons that new talks aren't likely to come about is that, as everyone learned in 1987, the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble. "Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929, that we were looking at a recession," Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview. "That did not happen.</seg>
<seg id="25">They learned they could survive it without much problem."</seg>
<seg id="26">But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta, who said a precipitous drop this week "is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy."</seg>
<seg id="27">In that case, there will be plenty of blame to go around. "There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be-that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas).</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, it clearly will take more than Friday's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation.</seg>
<seg id="30">"There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply didn't live up to this year's deal," Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on CBS News's "Face the Nation."</seg>
<seg id="31">During last week's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue, there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president's policy to include it.</seg>
<seg id="33">When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, hailed it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Asked if the administration agreed, he curtly replied: "The adminstration will have to speak for itself."</seg>
<seg id="35">Friday's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure, a process that isn't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate, which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The market needs a strong signal that we're serious about deficit reduction, and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill" of similar provisions, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.). said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="38">The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion.</seg>
<seg id="39">Rep. Panetta said that OMB's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts, but added: "We're getting very close to the margins here."</seg>
<seg id="40">No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday's drop in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="41">But some players were quick to seize the moment.</seg>
<seg id="42">Before the sun had set on Friday, Richard Rahn, the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains. "Investors, who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell, were spooked," he said.</seg>
<seg id="43">"There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut," Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance, "but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others."</seg>

<seg id="2">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="6">During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.</seg>

<seg id="3">"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"</seg>
<seg id="5">She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am angry."</seg>
<seg id="7">And then she just kept going.</seg>
<seg id="8">And I thought that was brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="9">Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Never let them see you crying," she told me.</seg>

<seg id="16">"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""</seg>

<seg id="21">She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.</seg>
<seg id="23">When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.</seg>
<seg id="24">"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.</seg>

<seg id="2">The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.</seg>
<seg id="6">China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mrs. Thatcher, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it, has made clear her opposition to refashioning Britain's free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="3">In return, Mrs. Thatcher is excoriated from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist.</seg>
<seg id="4">Well, it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders.</seg>
<seg id="5">"A disastrous farce in Malaysia," screamed the Manchester Guardian. "She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad." Egad.</seg>
<seg id="6">Canada's Brian Mulroney and Australia's Bob Hawke, the paper said, were "enraged." The London Times said she had "contravened protocol."</seg>
<seg id="7">As usual, her sin was saying what she thought.</seg>
<seg id="8">She issued a separate statement, separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="9">While supporting the Commonwealth "in utterly condemning apartheid," her statement urged it to "encourage change" rather than inflict further punishment on the country's black population.</seg>
<seg id="10">Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions: In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks, 85%, oppose economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still, Mrs. Thatcher had once again gone against the grain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed, "If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step." Mrs. Thatcher: "If it's one against 48, I'm very sorry for the 48."</seg>
<seg id="13">If indeed Mrs. Thatcher has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is Britain's mysteriously intractable inflation problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">We cannot, however, join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. Thatcher refuses to get along by going along.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain's voters will decide who is right about Europe, sanctioning South Africa or running Britain's economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">The U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives, government officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2">The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the officials, Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">They said the president conceded the notification requirement didn't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month's Panama coup effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">No notification was ever considered, officials said, apparently because the U.S. didn't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega, but merely sought to imprison him.</seg>
<seg id="8">What's more, both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12, a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the disclosure of the guidelines, first reported last night by NBC News, is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress.</seg>
<seg id="11">It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and, more broadly, for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad.</seg>
<seg id="12">A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman, Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added, "Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not only does this come close to a violation of law, it violates the trust we have all worked to develop."</seg>
<seg id="15">Sen. Boren said, "It's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee."</seg>
<seg id="17">Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the panel's vice chairman, said of the disclosure that "a text torn out of context is a pretext, and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion."</seg>
<seg id="18">Sen. Boren said the committee couldn't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline wasn't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead, both congressional and administration officials agreed, it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October.</seg>
<seg id="21">The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to.</seg>
<seg id="23">One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. "gets wind" of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life.</seg>
<seg id="24">But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although the notification guideline wasn't carried out in this month's coup attempt, some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="26">One senior administration official called the guideline "outrageous" and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble.</seg>
<seg id="27">The issue came to a head last year, officials recalled, partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on, the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last week, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups.</seg>
<seg id="31">The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, last week Mr. Webster's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nevertheless, the administration's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens.</seg>
<seg id="34">Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president.</seg>
<seg id="35">The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines, without changing the basic assassination ban, to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders.</seg>
<seg id="36">The new argument over the notification guideline, however, could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed.</seg>
