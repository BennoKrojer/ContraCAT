<seg id="1">Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'</seg>
<seg id="2">There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).</seg>
<seg id="3">It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="4">AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="5">One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."</seg>
<seg id="6">For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="8">A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.</seg>
<seg id="12">In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.</seg>
<seg id="14">AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.</seg>
<seg id="16">AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle</seg>
<seg id="2">"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Today, there's neither."</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="5">"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."</seg>
<seg id="7">As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."</seg>
<seg id="8">Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."</seg>
<seg id="10">Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.</seg>
<seg id="11">The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.</seg>
<seg id="12">A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.</seg>
<seg id="13">St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."</seg>
<seg id="16">The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."</seg>
<seg id="17">The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.</seg>
<seg id="19">What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.</seg>
<seg id="20">The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.</seg>

<seg id="2">A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!</seg>
<seg id="6">I got bit!'</seg>
<seg id="7">His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.</seg>
<seg id="9">The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="10">The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.</seg>
<seg id="12">Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sainsbury's plans push into UK beauty market</seg>
<seg id="2">Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.</seg>
<seg id="7">The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.</seg>
<seg id="12">The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.</seg>
<seg id="17">We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."</seg>

<seg id="2">Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV</seg>
<seg id="3">Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.</seg>
<seg id="5">This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.</seg>
<seg id="6">Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.</seg>
<seg id="8">The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.</seg>
<seg id="10">A source said: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">Her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it could mean the end of a long friendship.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.</seg>
<seg id="19">The couples holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.</seg>
<seg id="20">Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="21">A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."</seg>

<seg id="6">He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="7">But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.</seg>
<seg id="9">Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We were going to war with North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="13">Millions of people would have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now we have this great relationship."</seg>
<seg id="15">He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home.</seg>
<seg id="16">And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.</seg>
<seg id="8">While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.</seg>
<seg id="11">Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="12">A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.</seg>
<seg id="13">President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.</seg>
<seg id="14">But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."</seg>
<seg id="4">John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.</seg>
<seg id="11">His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."</seg>

<seg id="2">A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.</seg>
<seg id="8">A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="9">"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.</seg>
<seg id="10">Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.</seg>
<seg id="11">His body was found about an hour later.</seg>
<seg id="12">The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.</seg>
<seg id="13">A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.</seg>

<seg id="2">As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.</seg>
<seg id="10">Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="11">As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="12">Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.</seg>
<seg id="14">Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.</seg>
<seg id="15">The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.</seg>
<seg id="17">This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="20">October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.</seg>
<seg id="24">Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.</seg>
<seg id="25">Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="26">New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.</seg>
<seg id="8">Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.</seg>
<seg id="9">And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.</seg>
<seg id="12">ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="13">CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Interest remained high after the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?</seg>
<seg id="20">He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""</seg>
<seg id="21">Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.</seg>
<seg id="24">Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.</seg>
<seg id="25">After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.</seg>
<seg id="26">Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.</seg>

<seg id="3">Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.</seg>
<seg id="3">A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."</seg>
<seg id="6">Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.</seg>
<seg id="8">Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.</seg>
<seg id="11">The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.</seg>
<seg id="12">Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.</seg>
<seg id="14">I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's getting more and more tense," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory</seg>
<seg id="3">Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.</seg>
<seg id="8">Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors</seg>
<seg id="9">Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.</seg>
<seg id="10">Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.</seg>
<seg id="14">By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,</seg>
<seg id="15">That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.</seg>
<seg id="17">Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis</seg>
<seg id="19">BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena</seg>
<seg id="20">A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.</seg>
<seg id="21">To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="22">Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="23">He had so many heroes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rangers were short of inspiration, though.</seg>
<seg id="26">As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!</seg>
<seg id="6">Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="12">First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.</seg>
<seg id="14">The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.</seg>
<seg id="20">These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.</seg>

<seg id="2">"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.</seg>
<seg id="7">"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.</seg>
<seg id="8">The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising</seg>
<seg id="2">At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="11">The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.</seg>
<seg id="13">The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.</seg>
<seg id="17">Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.</seg>
<seg id="21">In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.</seg>
<seg id="23">Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.</seg>
<seg id="24">The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.</seg>
<seg id="25">The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.</seg>
<seg id="26">The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.</seg>
<seg id="27">President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.</seg>
<seg id="3">Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."</seg>
<seg id="4">West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.</seg>
<seg id="5">The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.</seg>
<seg id="6">He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.</seg>
<seg id="10">It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.</seg>
<seg id="11">The album is more of a reflection of who we are."</seg>
<seg id="12">He is one of a number of famous rappers to change their name.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. should double A.I. funding</seg>
<seg id="2">As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.</seg>
<seg id="3">The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="18">And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.</seg>

<seg id="2">The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.</seg>
<seg id="6">The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."</seg>
<seg id="7">Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.</seg>
<seg id="10">The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.</seg>
<seg id="14">Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.</seg>
<seg id="18">If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."</seg>
<seg id="22">A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.</seg>
<seg id="23">Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.</seg>
<seg id="26">A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dispatched of the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.</seg>
<seg id="3">Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his score in the 65th minute.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.</seg>
<seg id="5">He raced between three Brighton defenders, before slashing into the open field.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.</seg>
<seg id="7">He pushed around one defender before outrunning several more at the edge of the Brighton box.</seg>
<seg id="8">He then pushed a pass to his left, finding Sterling.</seg>
<seg id="9">The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We spoke about him playing 55, 60 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">That's what happened.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is intolerant of those who speak their minds</seg>
<seg id="3">When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.</seg>
<seg id="5">My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.</seg>
<seg id="6">In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."</seg>
<seg id="9">For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.</seg>
<seg id="11">It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.</seg>
<seg id="12">This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that is not just my experience.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.</seg>
<seg id="20">I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that is not what I came into politics to do.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.</seg>
<seg id="24">No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.</seg>
<seg id="25">To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.</seg>
<seg id="26">But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."</seg>
<seg id="7">Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.</seg>
<seg id="8">Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.</seg>
<seg id="9">But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.</seg>
<seg id="13">Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.</seg>
<seg id="3">Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.</seg>
<seg id="4">Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.</seg>
<seg id="5">To recover it is a duty."</seg>
<seg id="6">Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="10">Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.</seg>
<seg id="12">But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.</seg>
<seg id="15">And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.</seg>
<seg id="19">The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.</seg>
<seg id="20">Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."</seg>

<seg id="2">If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.</seg>
<seg id="3">Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.</seg>
<seg id="4">Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.</seg>
<seg id="6">Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.</seg>
<seg id="9">One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.</seg>
<seg id="10">And if you continue the huge fashion statement- you are in luck.</seg>
<seg id="11">Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.</seg>
<seg id="12">The out-sized hats come hot on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that's been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.</seg>
<seg id="13">The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.</seg>
<seg id="14">The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact it would be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.'</seg>

<seg id="1">John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.</seg>
<seg id="3">With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.</seg>
<seg id="5">As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.</seg>
<seg id="11">The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.</seg>
<seg id="12">This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="14">A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.</seg>
<seg id="16">With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.</seg>
<seg id="17">Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.</seg>
<seg id="21">Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.</seg>
<seg id="22">Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.</seg>
<seg id="23">A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="24">Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.</seg>
<seg id="25">Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.</seg>
<seg id="26">It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.</seg>
<seg id="27">Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."</seg>
<seg id="28">Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.</seg>
<seg id="29">Il faut bien le faire.</seg>

<seg id="10">Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.</seg>
<seg id="13">Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles</seg>
<seg id="2">After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.</seg>
<seg id="4">So where would they say the momentum is now?</seg>
<seg id="5">"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.</seg>
<seg id="8">Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.</seg>
<seg id="10">His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is all each of these players has left now.</seg>
<seg id="13">18 holes to make a mark.</seg>
<seg id="14">The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.</seg>
<seg id="15">Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.</seg>
<seg id="18">Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Talk of European glory remains premature, though.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.</seg>
<seg id="21">A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="24">Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.</seg>
<seg id="5">The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.</seg>
<seg id="9">Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.</seg>
<seg id="10">Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="13">They earned a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy.</seg>
<seg id="15">After being second-best for two days, however, a Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them.</seg>

<seg id="1">North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust</seg>
<seg id="2">North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.</seg>
<seg id="4">"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."</seg>
<seg id="6">While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.</seg>
<seg id="8">North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.</seg>
<seg id="9">Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.</seg>
<seg id="14">The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."</seg>
<seg id="18">China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."</seg>
<seg id="20">The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="23">He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."</seg>
<seg id="24">North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."</seg>
<seg id="25">He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.</seg>

<seg id="2">A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'</seg>
<seg id="3">An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.</seg>
<seg id="6">'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.</seg>
<seg id="8">The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.</seg>
<seg id="12">In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="13">A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.</seg>
<seg id="14">'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.</seg>
<seg id="15">But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.</seg>
<seg id="16">The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.</seg>
<seg id="20">The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.</seg>
<seg id="21">Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.</seg>
<seg id="6">And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.</seg>

<seg id="9">Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.</seg>
<seg id="10">They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.</seg>
<seg id="11">A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.</seg>
<seg id="13">Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.</seg>
<seg id="17">Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.</seg>
<seg id="18">Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.</seg>
<seg id="20">Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.</seg>

<seg id="2">And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.</seg>
<seg id="4">A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:</seg>
<seg id="5">Man: "What in the world is that?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.</seg>
<seg id="7">When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."</seg>
<seg id="8">Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"</seg>

<seg id="2">It Didn't Go Well</seg>
<seg id="3">Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="5">"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They bullied me backstage.</seg>
<seg id="12">They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">They bullied me!</seg>
<seg id="14">And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.</seg>
<seg id="15">West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?</seg>
<seg id="16">Try love."</seg>
<seg id="17">His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."</seg>
<seg id="18">West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="19">West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.</seg>
<seg id="20">West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."</seg>
<seg id="21">But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."</seg>
<seg id="22">"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is free.</seg>
<seg id="24">So are we," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'</seg>
<seg id="8">Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.</seg>
<seg id="9">He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?</seg>
<seg id="10">What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?</seg>
<seg id="12">Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'</seg>
<seg id="13">In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.</seg>
<seg id="14">From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.</seg>
<seg id="15">The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.</seg>
<seg id="16">'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.</seg>

<seg id="7">But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.</seg>
<seg id="8">Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.</seg>
<seg id="10">Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1">Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'</seg>
<seg id="2">U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.</seg>
<seg id="6">The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="8">Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.</seg>
<seg id="11">This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."</seg>
<seg id="12">Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="15">When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They must not be defiant.</seg>
<seg id="17">They must not question the motives of the accuser.</seg>
<seg id="18">They must be calm and serene."</seg>
<seg id="19">Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Big if true," he tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="22">In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."</seg>

<seg id="1">Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof</seg>
<seg id="2">It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.</seg>
<seg id="3">Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?</seg>
<seg id="4">At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="6">He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.</seg>
<seg id="8">I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="10">The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.</seg>
<seg id="11">The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.</seg>
<seg id="12">A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.</seg>
<seg id="16">English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.</seg>
<seg id="20">English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.</seg>
<seg id="21">All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Pretty moderate stuff.</seg>
<seg id="23">And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?</seg>

<seg id="1">Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days</seg>
<seg id="2">Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.</seg>
<seg id="3">The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.</seg>
<seg id="4">It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'</seg>
<seg id="9">The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500.</seg>

<seg id="1">What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?</seg>
<seg id="2">This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.</seg>
<seg id="6">But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?</seg>
<seg id="7">Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?</seg>
<seg id="8">Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.</seg>
<seg id="9">It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="10">In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.</seg>
<seg id="11">The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="14">The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.</seg>
<seg id="15">In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"</seg>
<seg id="16">Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.</seg>
<seg id="17">But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.</seg>
<seg id="18">Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.</seg>

<seg id="2">Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.</seg>
<seg id="8">He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.</seg>
<seg id="11">For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."</seg>
<seg id="12">Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.</seg>
<seg id="15">The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.</seg>
<seg id="16">Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>

<seg id="2">Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.</seg>
<seg id="5">"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."</seg>
<seg id="6">Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."</seg>

<seg id="2">Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.</seg>
<seg id="5">She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was detained in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="9">District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."</seg>
<seg id="12">Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.</seg>
<seg id="5">While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.</seg>
<seg id="6">China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="8">China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."</seg>
<seg id="9">"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="1">Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn</seg>
<seg id="2">As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.</seg>
<seg id="9">"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.</seg>
<seg id="10">But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."</seg>
<seg id="11">Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.</seg>

<seg id="12">The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."</seg>

<seg id="2">The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.</seg>
<seg id="5">A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."</seg>
<seg id="8">He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.</seg>
<seg id="10">Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.</seg>
<seg id="12">Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."</seg>

<seg id="2">Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.</seg>
<seg id="4">At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.</seg>

<seg id="2">Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."</seg>
<seg id="5">He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."</seg>
<seg id="9">He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="10">The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."</seg>
<seg id="12">The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.</seg>
<seg id="15">The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="18">My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."</seg>
<seg id="19">His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.</seg>

<seg id="2">American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.</seg>
<seg id="6">And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.</seg>
<seg id="13">I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.</seg>
<seg id="14">He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="16">It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He provides a lot more than just play."</seg>

<seg id="2">Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.</seg>
<seg id="4">"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.</seg>
<seg id="5">So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.</seg>
<seg id="6">You go full bore tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Get out there and do all the right things.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not over till you've got the points on the board.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.</seg>
<seg id="10">I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."</seg>
<seg id="11">Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tomorrow's a different beast.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."</seg>
<seg id="19">"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.</seg>
<seg id="21">When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.</seg>
<seg id="22">We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."</seg>
<seg id="23">Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Germany's new warship postponed yet again</seg>
<seg id="2">German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="4">The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.</seg>
<seg id="12">Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="18">Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."</seg>
<seg id="19">The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.</seg>
<seg id="20">He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.</seg>

<seg id="2">New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.</seg>
<seg id="5">Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.</seg>
<seg id="6">NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.</seg>
<seg id="8">A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.</seg>
<seg id="10">This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bats are not actually blind.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.</seg>
<seg id="16">They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.</seg>
<seg id="17">The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.</seg>
<seg id="19">The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.</seg>
<seg id="20">Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="24">He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.</seg>
<seg id="27">She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."</seg>

<seg id="2">Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.</seg>
<seg id="3">His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."</seg>
<seg id="7">"No, no, no, no , no.</seg>
<seg id="8">What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They want to promote themselves by using my name.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's normal.</seg>
<seg id="11">They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."</seg>
<seg id="15">The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.</seg>
<seg id="16">After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."</seg>
<seg id="18">The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."</seg>
<seg id="20">The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers</seg>
<seg id="2">The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.</seg>
<seg id="9">BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."</seg>
<seg id="17">Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.</seg>
<seg id="5">Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rosenstein denied the report.</seg>
<seg id="7">But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."</seg>
<seg id="14">Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.</seg>
<seg id="15">Host Chris Wallace asked why.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="17">She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."</seg>
<seg id="19">Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.</seg>
<seg id="20">We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="21">Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Solo press conferences are rare.</seg>
<seg id="23">In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless</seg>
<seg id="6">Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.</seg>
<seg id="7">The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.</seg>
<seg id="8">The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="9">The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.</seg>
<seg id="14">He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.</seg>
<seg id="16">He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.</seg>
<seg id="18">And that means fixing our broken housing market.</seg>
<seg id="19">Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.</seg>
<seg id="21">For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.</seg>
<seg id="4">He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I wanted to play for my country as a player.</seg>
<seg id="6">I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.</seg>
<seg id="8">That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."</seg>
<seg id="9">Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="15">He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.</seg>
<seg id="20">But playing can be tough.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.</seg>
<seg id="22">I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.</seg>
<seg id="23">I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."</seg>

<seg id="1">Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds</seg>
<seg id="2">The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.</seg>
<seg id="7">Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.</seg>
<seg id="9">Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."</seg>
<seg id="10">Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="11">Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.</seg>
<seg id="12">It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.</seg>
<seg id="13">The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."</seg>
<seg id="14">Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.</seg>

<seg id="2">A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.</seg>
<seg id="3">To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."</seg>
<seg id="5">The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.</seg>
<seg id="7">With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.</seg>
<seg id="9">Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)</seg>
<seg id="11">Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.</seg>
<seg id="12">But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."</seg>
<seg id="14">Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think this is a genus idea.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.</seg>
<seg id="18">The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a genius product," one wrote.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."</seg>
<seg id="22">At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.</seg>
<seg id="23">The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.</seg>
<seg id="26">By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="28">During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border</seg>
<seg id="2">The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.</seg>
<seg id="4">The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.</seg>
<seg id="12">The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="13">Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.</seg>
<seg id="14">They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.</seg>

<seg id="2">Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="4">"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."</seg>
<seg id="7">The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.</seg>
<seg id="8">France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."</seg>
<seg id="12">The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.</seg>
<seg id="13">UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."</seg>
<seg id="16">UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.</seg>

<seg id="2">By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="3">In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"</seg>
<seg id="4">As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.</seg>
<seg id="9">She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.</seg>
<seg id="10">The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why? she asked.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is entertainment value in the chaos.</seg>
<seg id="14">Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.</seg>
<seg id="16">And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.</seg>
<seg id="17">I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I thought it was sort of a joke, but it turns out they were right."</seg>

<seg id="2">It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.</seg>
<seg id="3">This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.</seg>
<seg id="5">The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off</seg>
<seg id="2">Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.</seg>
<seg id="4">State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.</seg>
<seg id="6">The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.</seg>
<seg id="7">As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.</seg>
<seg id="9">Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="3">A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.</seg>
<seg id="6">Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.</seg>
<seg id="7">They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.</seg>
<seg id="8">Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect</seg>
<seg id="2">Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.</seg>
<seg id="6">Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.</seg>
<seg id="9">Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="12">The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.</seg>
<seg id="14">Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.</seg>
<seg id="19">David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.</seg>
<seg id="9">He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="10">'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to make our own laws in our own country.'</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'</seg>
<seg id="15">Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.</seg>
<seg id="16">'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Please drop Chequers and start listening.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.</seg>
<seg id="20">'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'</seg>
<seg id="22">In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.</seg>
<seg id="23">'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'</seg>

<seg id="2">It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.</seg>
<seg id="3">From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.</seg>
<seg id="8">He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.</seg>

<seg id="1">That Was Really Bad Body Language</seg>
<seg id="2">President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't do it."</seg>
<seg id="7">Remember?</seg>
<seg id="8">Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?</seg>
<seg id="9">Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?</seg>
<seg id="10">Oh, no.</seg>
<seg id="11">I didn't leak."</seg>
<seg id="12">Well, wait one minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."</seg>
<seg id="17">But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="19">Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.</seg>

<seg id="2">The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.</seg>
<seg id="4">The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.</seg>
<seg id="6">Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.</seg>
<seg id="9">What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.</seg>
<seg id="12">American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.</seg>
<seg id="17">Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.</seg>

<seg id="1">Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive</seg>
<seg id="2">The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.</seg>
<seg id="4">He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .</seg>
<seg id="6">When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.</seg>
<seg id="8">When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."</seg>
<seg id="9">Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He erased her from his life," Hale said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.</seg>

<seg id="2">NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text</seg>
<seg id="3">A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."</seg>
<seg id="4">The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="6">"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.</seg>
<seg id="8">After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="12">The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.</seg>
<seg id="13">"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.</seg>
<seg id="14">She's not a racist.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.</seg>
<seg id="16">"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?</seg>
<seg id="17">Your newborn baby?</seg>
<seg id="18">Come on."</seg>
<seg id="19">Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."</seg>
<seg id="20">"You're going to go after someone like that?</seg>
<seg id="21">That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.</seg>
<seg id="22">While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."</seg>
<seg id="4">Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.</seg>
<seg id="8">I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."</seg>

<seg id="2">Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday," she said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everyone knew him for his smile.</seg>
<seg id="8">They always said his smile lit up any room."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he gave up work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms Davis said: "I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."</seg>

<seg id="14">Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.</seg>

<seg id="2">"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.</seg>
<seg id="3">Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?</seg>
<seg id="4">Their reluctance is all due to timing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.</seg>
<seg id="6">George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.</seg>
<seg id="7">What happens after the FBI produces its report?</seg>
<seg id="8">There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="2">The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pyongyang has made no public comments.</seg>
<seg id="6">The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="7">Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.</seg>
<seg id="9">China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.</seg>

<seg id="2">House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="6">During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.</seg>

<seg id="4">"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"</seg>
<seg id="5">She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am angry."</seg>
<seg id="7">And then she just kept going.</seg>
<seg id="8">And I thought that was brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="9">Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Never let them see you crying," she told me.</seg>

<seg id="15">In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""</seg>
<seg id="19">Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, and so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she raised $2 million.</seg>

<seg id="22">"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.</seg>
<seg id="23">When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.</seg>
<seg id="24">"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.</seg>

<seg id="3">Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.</seg>
<seg id="6">China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.</seg>
<seg id="8">Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.</seg>
