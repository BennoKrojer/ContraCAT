<seg id="1">Custodians of ethics: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the action of the Vilnius branch</seg>
<seg id="2">“Decisions taken by the Board are in line with the Articles of Association,” Vytautas Tamošiūnas, the head of the Commission, said to BNS after the Commission meeting.</seg>
<seg id="3">“That decision of ours was not something new.</seg>
<seg id="4">We, as the Commission, gave our explanation already in July, when the issue about Pagėgiai and Utena had come up.</seg>
<seg id="5">We said then that according to the Articles of Association, this issue is within the competence of the Board.</seg>
<seg id="6">And if the Board decides that a particular branch can behave as it wishes - to run with a committee, and the Board approves of that, then that branch can run so, but if the Board decides that the party will run everywhere with party lists, which is what the Board has decided, then it is a decision for all branches to form party lists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And if someone does not agree with the Board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and run with a committee," he added.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to V. Tamošiūnas, now the Board of the party is to decide on its further course of action.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 17 October, the Board of the political party Liberal Movement cancelled the decision of the Vilnius city branch to participate in the municipal elections not with a party list, but with a list of an elections committee, which is currently being formed.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the opinion of the Board of the party, the decision of the liberals in the capital city to participate in the elections in the form of a public elections committee is in breach of the Articles of Association of the party, decisions of the Board.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Vilnius branch was to waive its intentions to participate in the municipal elections with a committee list by 31 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the branch failed to do that.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aušrinė Armonaitė, former head of the branch, a member of the Seimas, has already left the Liberal Movement.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Šimašius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement, who intends to run for the second term as the Mayor of Vilnius, has already introduced the team and ideas of the public elections committee “For Vilnius we are proud of!”.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also has left the party.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elections for municipal councils and offices of mayors will be held in March next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Residents of a North Indian village used a tractor to crush a tigress, who had torn up a man, the officers reported on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers circled the female tiger after it killed a man working in the fields late Sunday, and when the tiger tried to escape, the villagers crushed it under the wheels of a tractor.</seg>
<seg id="3">Villagers said the tiger had injured another young man in an attack about 10 days ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The village is inside the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri area, approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="5">Killing a tiger in protected areas is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reserve’s director Ramesh Pandey said that the case in question would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act .</seg>
<seg id="7">In April, villagers had beaten up another tiger in Nighasan area of the state of Uttar Pradesh; it suffered severe injuries.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tiger is India's national animal; it is categorized as endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year’s government data show that, in the last three years, at least one person was killed per day in confrontations with wild tigers or elephants.</seg>
<seg id="10">The human conflicts with tigers has gradually increased since the 8th decade, when India started a tiger conservation program that carved out sanctuaries in national parks, and made it a crime to kill a big cat.</seg>
<seg id="11">Though methods for counting tigers have changed, a census suggests the population of about 1,800 tigers then grew to 2,226 in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is proposed to mark cats and dogs with microchips mandatorily</seg>
<seg id="2">Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, and other members of the Seimas registered draft amendments to the Law on the Welfare and Protection of Animals, proposing to mark cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips under the mandatory procedure.</seg>
<seg id="3">“We propose that cats and dogs would have to be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking would be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2019 marking of all dogs, in 2020 also of all cats would be funded by the state, therefore, people would not have problems and the costs would be covered from special state financial assignments,” said Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The amendments to the Law are aimed at dealing with the need of systemic marking of pets.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that it will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible pet owners, illegal breeders or sellers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is preliminarily assessed that based on the average price of the chip and the chip implantation service, which will be about EUR 5, all pet owners will be compensated during the transitional period.</seg>
<seg id="8">The total price of marking all pets can amount up to EUR 6 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is planned that the use of the funds will span over the period of three years and will amount to EUR 2 million per year.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is expected that the funds for the marking programs will be assigned through the Special Program of the Municipalities for Supporting Environmental Protection, the income of which will grow significantly this year due to increase in taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to K. Mažeika, the mandatory marking is practiced in almost all Member States of the European Union, that also allows protecting pets (as lost pets can be easily returned to their owners), and saves pet owners’ time as they usually need much time and money in search for a runaway and lost pet.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides, the EU legal acts say that one can travel only with marked pets.</seg>
<seg id="14">Marking also obligates the owner to take care of the pet responsibly throughout its life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Previous proposals to impose mandatory marking were objected to, as it was proposed to finance relevant programs with people’s money.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The current model should be spared this criticism, as it is proposed to finance pet protection with increased income in the program for supporting environmental protection and to give the right to do the marking not only to veterinarians but also to public activists, i.e. persons in animal shelters who have taken special courses in the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the draft say.</seg>
<seg id="17">The draft law has been registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing various factions in the Seimas: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is most probably only a coincidence, but the glamorous brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė keeps getting roles related to liars.</seg>
<seg id="3">At first it was TV series "Women are better liars", then the play “Women liars” and, finally, the comedy movie “Liars”.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this movie, Brigita plays a petulant wife of the character played by Dainius Kazlauskas.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I really liked playing in the movie “Liars”, but I am a theater actress more and rarely appear in movies.</seg>
<seg id="6">A wonderful team of colleagues promised a great result from the very outset.</seg>
<seg id="7">This experience is very important and valuable for me.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the most interesting thing that happened on the shooting set was the puppy Sunny!</seg>
<seg id="9">All my life I believed that if I had a dog, it would really be big and solemn.</seg>
<seg id="10">I have never had a crush on those little, ornamental doggies of silly blondes.</seg>
<seg id="11">But during shooting Sunny got so attached to me that the sympathy has become mutual and finally I even wanted to buy it from its owner, but unsuccessfully,” the actor smiled.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new Lithuanian comedy “Liars” produced by Paulius Virbickas, the producer of the Lithuanian movie hits “Inexperienced” and “Speaking among us, boys...”, and by producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas, gets the viewers involved into comic and intriguing family peripeteias already from the first minutes of the movie.</seg>

<seg id="14">It would be a wonderful news, but... your beloved is your brother’s wife!</seg>

<seg id="1">Decision on whether to write off EUR 100 million of overdue emigrants’ taxes is to be taken</seg>
<seg id="2">On Tuesday, the Seimas accepted an amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of Residence proposed by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the “farmers” party, for consideration.</seg>
<seg id="3">56 members of the Seimas voted in favor of it, 9 - against, and 25 abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Seimas will continue consideration of the amendments on 6 December or later, after it gets an opinion from the Government.</seg>
<seg id="5">R. Karbauskis says that these payments accrue for people who did not declare their departure from Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the member of the Seimas, one person fails to pay about EUR 1,000 of taxes in a period of three years, and currently the number of such persons is about 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">A social-democrat Algirdas Sysas feared that in this way the Seimas “will encourage some people to defy their duties” by declaring departure and then no taxes would be charged.</seg>
<seg id="8">A conservative Antanas Matulas, member of the Committee of Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians, who live abroad, abuse the situation as, paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for medical treatment and receive the same services as the residents who pay this tax.</seg>
<seg id="9">The amendments provide that those persons, who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation, and are released by Sodra from the duty to pay health insurance contributions in Lithuania, would be considered as having departed from Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of Sodra, noted previously that such a step will make both the life of emigrants and the operations of Sodra easier.</seg>

<seg id="2">It has been filmed how a mother bear climbs a steep snow-covered slope, while her cub keeps climbing, sliding down and again persistently climbing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The video had many reviews and comments.</seg>
<seg id="4">People admired the little bear’s persistency - having slipped multiple times, it used to resume its journey towards its mother.</seg>
<seg id="5">It does not succeed at first, but the cub does not even try to give up and finally reaches its goal.</seg>
<seg id="6">The video really captures attention but it also reveals the danger people cause for animals.</seg>
<seg id="7">Scientists say that one has also to speak that people’s wish to get to know wildlife sometimes can be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="8">“It is obvious to me that the drone scared the bears greatly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their movements show that they panic.</seg>
<seg id="10">If there had been no drone flying around, they would have probably chosen a safer way or would have taken it slower or with more caution.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a perfect example of how drones should not be used,” the ecologist Mark Ditmer said to the publication “The Verge”.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some time ago, M. Ditmer and his colleagues researched how drones were affecting bears.</seg>
<seg id="13">Heart monitors were placed on the animals.</seg>
<seg id="14">When a drone used to come close, some bears started running, while others did not, but the hearts of all of them were pounding with fear.</seg>
<seg id="15">Scientists advise to use drones for filming animals in a responsible manner, not to fly too close, not to cause noise and not to fly where that is forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="1">Addressing the runaway President in a newspaper</seg>
<seg id="2">On Tuesday, Kiev court invited the overturned President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia, to arrive to a hearing of the case, where he is suspected of high treason, in an unusual manner - the summons were published in the official publication of the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court summons, published in the government news gazette Uriadovy Kurier, calls the former leader to arrive to a hearing in the criminal proceedings on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document indicates that V. Yanukovych has the right to take part in the hearing by way of a video conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 30 October, the Kiev court announced having finished debates in V. Yanukovych’s case.</seg>
<seg id="6">V. Yanukovych’s advocate Aleksandr Goroshinskiy, working in Russia, was given an opportunity to register in the register of foreign advocates by 19 November in order to be able to participate in the hearing where V. Yanukovych, as it is expected, would say his final word by use of video conference.</seg>
<seg id="7">V. Yanukovych, supported by the Kremlin, was overturned and fled to Russia during the Maidan insurrection in February 2014, which had been provoked by the President’s refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="9">In March that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula that belonged to Ukraine, and some time later a war started in the East of the country between Kiev and separatists supported by Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since then, the battles took lives of about 10,000 people in spite of multiple attempts of the international community to ensure long-term truce.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restrictions on cogeneration power plants appealed before the Constitutional Court</seg>
<seg id="2">The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed against the decision of the ruling parties to pass the law on a possibility to stop construction of waste-to-energy plants before the Constitutional Court (CC).</seg>
<seg id="3">On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition faction of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) notified that a group of members of the Seimas addressed the CC with an application for investigating whether the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties are in line with the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="4">“The members of the Seimas emphasize that provisions of the law aim to challenge the currently ongoing projects of waste incineration facilities, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance to a residential territory) on waste-to-energy plants that started to be constructed in Vilnius and Kaunas before the effective date of the law,” the notification says.</seg>
<seg id="5">It adds that “the members of the Seimas note that taking into account how the law words the prohibition to construct waste management objects of national importance (i.e. determines a distance and defines the concept of “residential territory”), a conclusion is to be made that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to perform economic activities related to burning of waste to produce energy, as the established criteria are worded so that, having in mind the population density and distribution in Lithuania, construction of such objects would be practically impossible in the whole territory of the country”.</seg>
<seg id="6">The application says that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.</seg>
<seg id="7">“The CC has indicated for a number of times that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the effective date of a newly adopted legal act.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this case, the Government is given powers to apply the law retroactively, following an indefinite criterion.</seg>
<seg id="9">Imposing such legal regulation violates the constitution principles of legal certainty, legal safety, protection of legitimate expectations, consequently, the constitutional principle of the rule of law,” the application indicates.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also notes that big financial investments have already been made to the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stopping of the currently ongoing projects would inflict a financial loss of hundreds of millions on the State, the Lithuanian population would suffer huge losses, too - heating prices would increase, the growing volumes of waste in dumpsites would result in increased environmental pollution.</seg>
<seg id="12">The application to the CC has been signed by members from Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions and by Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy head of a ruling Social Democratic Labor faction.</seg>
<seg id="13">A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mostly from the ruling parties, in order to reject the veto of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments to the Law on Waste Management, providing for the right of the Government to stop already started construction of cogeneration power plants, also set a buffer zone of 20 km from residential locations for construction of such power plants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The amendments to the law repeated adopted by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019. By the way, the ruling parties already propose to drop the 20 km restriction.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is planned to consider this proposal already in the autumn session of the Seimas.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the Seimas does not plan to cancel the right of the Government to stop already started projects.</seg>
<seg id="17">The CC will examine the case in the order of sequence, which is a year later at the earliest.</seg>

<seg id="1">V. Ačienė about detention of R. Ačas: I believe my husband is innocent and I believe in law enforcement</seg>
<seg id="2">"That was the most unexpected thing to me that I could never think of.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the other hand, the authorities probably are just doing their job.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each of us are doing our job.</seg>
<seg id="5">I believe in law enforcement authorities, I believe my husband, that everything is just and fair, that he has not taken any unfair actions,” V. Ačienė told BNS.</seg>
<seg id="6">R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (SIS) on Monday - the law enforcement authorities suspect that he, while being the Director of the Administration of the Raseiniai Municipality, took a bribe of big value, and in exchange he could have created exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus fleet controlled by the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is suspected that representatives of private companies directly paid off R. Ačas or were involved in disguising bribes as various financial operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">In April this year, the Council of the Raseiniai District Municipality dismissed R. Ačas from the office of the head of the Administration at the third attempt after a statement of distrust in him had been made.</seg>
<seg id="9">In March this year, a former member of the Order and Justice became a member of the newly founded Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, he suspended his membership in this political party on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="10">R. Ačas unsuccessfully ran for the office of the mayor as a representative of the electoral committee “Tavo Raseiniai” several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="11">V. Ačienė says that her husband was not going to run for the Raseiniai mayor next year, but he has not decided yet on participation in the elections for the municipal councils.</seg>
<seg id="12">V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas on the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anticorruption Commission.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician said she would wait for further actions of the law enforcement authorities - her decision on removing herself from the work in the Commission would depend on them.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I am really not taking any fast decisions today, I will make up my mind this week, I think.</seg>
<seg id="15">I will see, if it becomes necessary, depending on the type of accusations, it is clear that I will have to take some decision.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is probably necessary that I would stay away from all those matters investigated in the Anticorruption Commission, but again - time will reveal the truth,” she spoke.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the conservatives in opposition in the Seimas, urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the leader of the “farmers’” party Ramūnas Karbauskis to dissociate from statements of the faction colleague Vida Ačienė and to remove her from the Seimas Anticorruption Commission, transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.</seg>
<seg id="18">She says that further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anticorruption Commission "would cause grounded lack of trust in the society and would discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".</seg>

<seg id="2">The President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favorable investment environment for the European Union (EU) investments, to ease conditions for foreign import.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, while opening the trade and investment forum, D. Grybauskaitė accentuated that witnessing signs of slowdown in economy, the common goal of Europe and China should be “to unite efforts to stop spreading of protectionism in the world”, aiming at essential reasons of the tension caused by trade wars, “overproduction and unfair competition”.</seg>
<seg id="4">“The commitment of China to create a more attractive, open environment for investments is very important for the European Union - it is important in negotiating for a trade agreement with China.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is important to finalize this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business would feel welcome and secure here, also by way of strengthening intellectual property protection,” said D. Grybauskaitė.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to her, opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for China, as well as for the global economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Lithuanian leader emphasized that investment transparency must be “above interests of any business group”.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Transparency, supremacy of laws, strict adherence to international agreements - that must be essential for the environment of new investment relationships,” D. Grybauskaitė underlined.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Corrupted capital flows should not be welcome in any country of the world - not only here or in our countries,” she added.</seg>
<seg id="10">By hosting the import exhibition, China attempts to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leaders of a number of countries participate in the exhibition, over 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions in the world, including Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, currently China is the 25th among export partners.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, the export of Lithuania to China grew by 50 percent - this amounted to EUR 180 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the volume of import from China exceeded EUR 820 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some officials are concerned that Chinese investments in Lithuania can bring undesired political influence, and the peculiar attention of Beijing to the Eastern Europe undermines the EU unity.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cause of Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of the victims are furious</seg>
<seg id="2">Data from a black box retrieved from the crashed plane of the Indonesian airlines Lion Air has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its speed indicator on at least four of its last flights, investigators reported on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The head of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Soerjanto Tjahjono told that the plane had suffered similar problems on its last four flights, including the fatal one, when on 29 October the plane plunged into the Java Sea soon after the take-off in Djakarta.</seg>
<seg id="4">The disaster killed all 189 people on board.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many of the mass media reported problems during the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital city of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="6">“When we opened the black box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or, in other words, the speed of the plane,” S. Tjahjono said in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="7">“Data from the black box showed that the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the same problem,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="8">“There have been lots of rumors on social media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, we want to explain that in the black box there were (data remaining) about four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator,” the head of KNKT indicated.</seg>
<seg id="10">During a meeting with victims’ family members, S. Tjahjono said that information of the flight data recorder was consistent with reports that after the plane took off for its last flight, its speed and altitude were erratic.</seg>
<seg id="11">The searchers have not found the second black box yet, which records the talks in the pilots’ cockpit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lion Air indicated that after a technical failure was identified during the flight from Bali to Djakarta, it was repaired as per manafacturer’s recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of the company, was not invited to speak by the Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseeing the effort of search for the plane and victim remains and the accident investigation.</seg>
<seg id="14">But he stood and bowed his head after angry and distraught family members demanded that R. Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan founded Lion Air in 1999, identify himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Lion Air has failed,” said a man who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who had been a prosecutor in the island, where the plane would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="16">“I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,” he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="17">- Since the time of the crisis, I was never contacted by Lion Air.</seg>
<seg id="18">We lost our child, but Lion Air has not shown any empathy to us.”</seg>
<seg id="19">After the meeting, R. Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from reporters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many families are waiting for results of the long process of identifying victims.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police medical experts have received nearly 140 bodybags of human remains.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only 14 victims have been identified so far.</seg>
<seg id="23">The families have been asking why the two-month-old plane was given flight clearance at all, given that there was a failure reported on a flight from Bali to Jakarta on 28 October, where it descended rapidly right after the take-off, much to the terror of passengers on board.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Lion Air said that this fault was fixed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Is it true the problem was cleared?” a son of a victim asked.</seg>
<seg id="26">- If not, technicians in charge must be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="27">The law is absolute because they have stated that the plane was cleared to take off again.</seg>
<seg id="28">These bad technicians must be processed by law to prevent plane accidents from continuing in Indonesia.”</seg>
<seg id="29">S. Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that debris was found in a relatively small area indicate that the plane probably hit the water at a very high speed.</seg>
<seg id="30">“The plane was intact when it plunged to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="31">It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft engine was running at high RPM when it touched the water - it's marked by the loss of all the blades of the turbine,” the official explained.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan.</seg>

<seg id="1">President’s Office: no artificial easing regarding referendums is necessary</seg>
<seg id="2">If the Seimas approves of the proposal of those in power to lower the referendum threshold for Chapter I of the Constitution, which is currently subject to stronger protection, the President would veto the amendments, her advisor Mindaugas Lingė says.</seg>
<seg id="3">“More than a half of the population voted for the Constitution - such is the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, its amendment, particularly of the articles in its Chapter I, should be subject to no less majority vote.</seg>
<seg id="5">It can be easily predicted that the President would really veto it," internal policy advisor to Dalia Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">He emphasized that Chapter One of the Constitution defines fundamental matters of the state - the language, the flag, the territory, the capital city, the sovereignty of the state, therefore, if the number of votes necessary to amend these articles were reduced, this, according to M. Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "would open a way for uncontrollable risk".</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the opinion of the President, no artificial easing is necessary, rather more efforts should be used to get ready for the very referendum, there should be more dialogue with people,” he was trying to convince.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Tuesday, the Seimas is to vote on adoption of an amendment to the Law on Referendum.</seg>
<seg id="9">It provides that a decision on amendments to Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution, which enjoy a higher level of protection, is to be taken if it is supported by at least two fifths of the citizens having the right to vote in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="10">Currently, articles of Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution can be amended by way of a referendum if voted in favor of by more than a half of all the citizens having the voting right.</seg>
<seg id="11">The right to vote in Lithuania is vested in about 2.5 million citizens: the half would mean 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">The proposal was made after in September the Seimas approved the President’s veto regarding amendments previously adopted by the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding the number of votes necessary to amend Article 12 of Chapter One of the Constitution that defines citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is proposed to lower the referendum threshold in getting ready for the referendum regarding double citizenship, which should be held on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, save for certain exceptions, emigrants, who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, cannot have a double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="15">The double citizenship is sought by the global Lithuanian community, but initiators are afraid that under current conditions the referendum would fail - the turnout would be insufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure starts to be inadequate, therefore, it is necessary to renovate it, says the Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to him, renovation of the Vilnius airport is the minimal target that the State must achieve.</seg>
<seg id="4">“Air transport infrastructure is already falling behind as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.</seg>
<seg id="5">We must renovate the Vilnius airport - that is not even a matter of long-term planning, it is the minimum that we must do,” said Mr. Masiulis on Tuesday in the conference on transport and communications organized by the Democracy Development Foundation and the magazine “Valstybė”.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica will have to be completed, the Klaipėda external harbor will have to be built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to be renovated, or maybe a new airport will have to be constructed.</seg>
<seg id="7">“The next decade will be very important - we have to finish integration of roads, railways, construction of the external harbor in Klaipėda, to manage the airports, probably decide to build a new airport.</seg>
<seg id="8">It’s not time to sleep, we must start the projects now, which will enable to exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years time,” the Minister of Transport and Communications said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Masiulis repeated that too little money had been assigned for maintenance of motor roads in the recent years.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The condition of roads is not improving yet, as the assignments are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are able to construct new roads, but there is not enough money even for the most necessary maintenance, for example, of main roads.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must determine an amount, how much should be assigned for road maintenance if we want the condition of roads to improve,” Mr. Masiulis said.</seg>
<seg id="13">He emphasized that the export of services in the Lithuanian transport sector has grown 18.6% this year and Germany has become the largest export market, leaving Russia the second.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Masiulis again criticized the European Commission’s proposal, according to which the carriers of the EU countries will have to periodically return trucks to the country of their registration.</seg>
<seg id="15">“We must seek that our exporters would feel at home in Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to keep coming home is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks driving in it, burning fuel and increasing emissions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The winners in this case are going to be the railways as costs will increase so that some freight will go to railways.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are looking for ways to defend our position,” Mr. Masiulis said.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector creates 12.2% of the</seg>
<seg id="20">gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="21">It employs over 118,000 people in over 7,500 companies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dispute with heritage protection authorities</seg>
<seg id="23">Last week, Mr. Masiulis notified the Seimas Committee on Economics that he had started negotiations for changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - that would enable to pull down the old terminal and to build a new one.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the acting head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (DCH) Algimantas Degutis called Mr. Masiulis’ considerations political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to him, the building, which was built in the sixth decade of the last century, is a cultural value entered into the register in 1993, and it is not for politicians, but for specialists to decide on its deletion from the register.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrivals terminal would help to improve the image of Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Deletion of the old terminal from the heritage register would be a politically important step in order that we could demolish it and build a new modern arrivals terminal so that upon arrival to Vilnius, travelers could feel themselves in a modern country, rather than in a curiosity place that really does not strike as representing our country as an innovative one,” Mr. Masiulis asserted last week in the Seimas.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Masiulis then also informed that Kaunas plans to build an absolutely new passenger terminal and connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track, building an underground station.</seg>
<seg id="29">This transport hub should be put into operation in 2026, when the construction of Rail Baltica is completed.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the Vilnius airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, next year - 5 million.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Kaunas airport served 1.2 million passengers in total last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">“We must always make preparations for harder times.</seg>
<seg id="3">I am delighted to say that it is for the first time in the Lithuanian history that we keep accumulating reserves for the third year in a row.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is also very important not to convince oneself to be already sick," said V. Šapoka on Monday, during his visit in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="5">ELTA reminds that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and the Vice-minister Miglė Tuskienė are taking part in meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="6">ECOFIN meeting is to discuss issues related to taxing of digital services.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new tax is aimed at avoiding fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already imposed or are going to impose a certain tax on the national level.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the short term, it is proposed to agree how income received from provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed, while there is no global agreement yet.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Eurogroup will overview draft budgets of the countries in the euro area presented to the European Commission (EC).</seg>
<seg id="10">On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft budget of Italy as not in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is for the first time that the EC makes use of this right given to it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have been requested to provide more information.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Eurogroup is also to discuss the Economic and Monetary Union strengthening issues: the European deposit insurance system implementation possibilities and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) reforms.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programs, but it is believed that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid repetition of functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lithuanian work traditions and customs</seg>
<seg id="3">It has been 120 years since the birth of Balys Buračas (1897-1972), famous Lithuanian photographer and chronicler of culture, ethnographer and specialist of regional studies, who was born in Sidariai, Šiaulėnai district, the then Šiauliai governorate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commemorating the centenary of the State of Lithuania, we have a perfect occasion to remember how the vivacious national revival called many Lithuanian people, including the Buračai brothers - Balys, Jonas, Bronius - from the very village depths to get involved with all their creative powers into cherishing, preservation and giving sense to our cultural traditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Balys Buračas, who travelled the native land for over 50 years with a photo camera in his hands, gave a wide and truthful image of customs, traditions, folk art and tangible culture of our country.</seg>
<seg id="6">He sought to preserve the rapidly diminishing riches of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the historical value of work he was doing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Balys Buračas’ photos with Lithuanian scenery, mounds, our people in national costumes in everyday environment and in festivals illustrated pages of Lithuanian papers and magazines.</seg>
<seg id="8">This publication contains a large part of Balys Buračas’ legacy intended for description of national work customs and related traditions and, what is most important, their attractive iconography.</seg>
<seg id="9">The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization during the past century in spite of two world wars and oppressive occupation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manuscript of the book has ample descriptions written down by Balys Buračas of work, work related festivals and other traditions and customs in Lower Lithuania, especially of Kupiškis, Šiaulėnai, Telšiai people, also of people in Aukštaitija and Dzūkija regions in the period between the two world wars.</seg>
<seg id="11">Out of about 10,000 remaining negatives kept in museums and archives, over 400 rare photos, most of which have never been published, were selected for this publication, which have been grouped according to chosen texts.</seg>
<seg id="12">They reflect unique aspects of ethnical culture, characteristic of Kupiškis, Dzūkija people, other districts in Aukštaitija and Žemaitija regions.</seg>

<seg id="2">The newlyweds, who got married just few hours ago, died in a helicopter crash in the southwest Texas, the USA.</seg>
<seg id="3">William Troy Byler and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, both 24, died on Sunday soon after midnight after the helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Uvalde and 129 kilometers west of San Antonio, said Steven Kennedy, local justice of the peace.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is strange that the crash happened after flying about 24 kilometers, which coincides with the age of the newlyweds.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 76-year-old helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">They got married on Saturday evening in the Byler family ranch near Uvalde and after the marriage ceremony left aboard a family helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="8">The crash happened about 24 kilometers from where the helicopter took off.</seg>
<seg id="9">The flight was to carry the newlyweds to San Antonio International Airport, where they were to board a plane for their honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, who did not indicate the couple’s final destination.</seg>
<seg id="10">“It's a very rocky, rough terrain and this particular hill has a 120-150 meter rise,” S. Kennedy said.</seg>
<seg id="11">G.D. Lawrence had been a family’s pilot for many years.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had also flown helicopters in Vietnam during his service, S. Kennedy said.</seg>
<seg id="13">An autopsy on the pilot should reveal his physical condition and whether it might have been a factor in the crash.</seg>
<seg id="14">The helicopter crashed about 5 to 10 minutes after takeoff.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its wreckage was strewn across the rugged hillside at a wide radius, leaving the main body of the aircraft "hanging perilously," Craig Hatch, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said at a news conference on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Investigators plan to retrieve the wreckage before performing their close inspection, but it would not be easy for a trailer and a truck to reach the place, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cause of the crash hasn't been determined, but a preliminary NTSB report should be issued in two weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2">“Today is a historic day,” B. Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, according to his office.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Today is the day when the USA, under the President (Donald) Trump, imposes particularly harsh sanctions on Iran, the harshest sanctions on Iran over the whole time when efforts to tame its aggression started,” said the leader of the Israeli government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the new sanctions a “critical” blow to Israel’s actions in the region.</seg>
<seg id="5">The measures described by Washington as “the toughest sanctions ever” follow D. Trump’s controversial decision made in May to abandon the multi-nation deal with Tehran about its nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="6">The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran’s oil exports, which have already fallen by around one million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off from international finance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Israel had long opposed the said Iran deal, saying it was too limited in scope and timeframe.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Jewish state also says that lifting of sanctions allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Israel is particularly concerned with Iran’s involvement in the neighboring Syria and has pledged to keep it from entrenching itself militarily there.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other parties to the Iran deal – Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia – oppose the US move and say the deal is working as intended in keeping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a case of motor accident in the Vilnius neighborhood Šiaurės miestelis that ended in the death of a young biker, the court is to hear witness evidence.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Tuesday, the Vilnius Regional Court decided that in order to find out all significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case was to be examined in the next hearing on 26 November.</seg>
<seg id="4">A verdict of not guilty has been already given in the case, but the public prosecutors disagree.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 22 August, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted a car driver 79-year-old Eduardas Osipovas of the fatal motorcycle accident by announcing that the biker was driving at great speed in the city and made a gross violation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office asks the regional court to reverse the verdict of the district court and says that the major fault for the accident lies namely with E. Osipovas, and conclusions of the district court are unfounded.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family lawyer of the deceased biker also asks for reversal of the verdict of not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="8">The accident happened on 11 August 2015 at 15:00, when Škoda Fabia driven by E. Osipovas turned from Lakūnų street into Žirmūnų street and collided with the motorcycle that was driving the main road.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Prosecutor’s Office charged the car driver of violating the traffic rules, which required to give way, and causing the traffic accident, which killed the man driving the motorcycle Piaggo on the main way.</seg>
<seg id="10">The initial police reports say that it was a scooter driver who died, but later the investigation determined that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle according to its power.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rolandas Bužinskas, judge of the Vilniaus City District Court, said to BNS that experts had determined that the biker drove at the speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour though the permissible speed at the place was 50 kilometers per hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The car driver could not foresee that the motorcycle would be going so fast,” the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the elderly car driver said his speed was just 5-6 kilometers per hour.</seg>
<seg id="14">Upon seeing the obstacle, the biker was braking and fell off the motorcycle before hitting Škoda Fabia.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Prosecutor’s Office thinks that E. Osipovas, who left the side road for the main road, had to give way to the biker.</seg>

<seg id="1">CEC will distribute money to political parties but will not give anything to the Social Democratic Labor Party</seg>
<seg id="2">The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is going to distribute a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the biggest political parties this week .</seg>
<seg id="3">The ruling Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania (LSDDP) founded this spring, which is headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, a Deputy Speaker of the Seimas, is not to be given any money from the budget yet.</seg>
<seg id="4">But some funds can be assigned already in the nearest future by a separate decision of the CEC if the legal environment, regulating distribution of grants to political parties, changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Laura Matjošaitytė, the CEC Chairman, informed VŽ that “a meeting of the commission is to be held on Thursday, where the commission is to take a decision regarding distribution of the semi-annual grant from the budget to political parties”.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to her, the CEC is to take a decision on this issue by 15 November.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is planned to distribute EUR 2.751 million to seven political parties, six of which are represented in the Seimas. euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats in opposition should get over 0.66 million euros, the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million euros, the Social Democratic Party in opposition - about 0.5 million euros, the Liberal Movement in opposition - almost 0.4 million euros, the Labor Party that does not have its faction in the Seimas - about 0.23 million euros, the Party Order and Justice, which recently joined the ruling faction - almost 0.22 million euros, the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, which is represented in the Seimas but which treats itself neither a ruling party nor a party in opposition - about 0.18 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the currently effective law, which the CEC will comply with when distributing the budget money, grants are to be assigned to political parties, which meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of votes in the past elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow LSDDP, which was founded only this spring, to expect any money from the budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is so because this party has not been in an election yet.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the ruling coalition seeks to amend the law in order that the Social Democratic Labor Party would get at least a couple hundred thousand euros, as even three elections will be held next year - municipal, presidential and to the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="13">Relevant amendments to the Law on Political Parties and laws on the budget for this year, as adopted by the Seimas, have been vetoed by the President Dalia Grybauskaitė.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Seimas has not yet made up its mind regarding this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the Farmers and Greens Union, say that the Seimas will seek to reject the President’s objections.</seg>
<seg id="15">But that will not be made by the CEC meeting this Thursday, therefore, according to Ms. Matjošaitytė, “grants will be distributed according to the legal procedure that has existed until now”.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the CEC Chairman admitted that if this or next week the Seimas rejected the President’s veto and the new amendments on distribution of the budget money to political parties came into effect, the CEC may consider a decision on assigning an additional grant to individual political forces, including LSDDP.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Taking our decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, as we are an executive authority that has to implement laws that are adopted,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="18">If the Seimas were able to overturn the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government would assign additional money to parties according to them, having borrowed additional amounts for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="19">The grants already distributed to seven parties would not be diminished by reason of such a decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poroshenko: those who ordered killing of the activist Handziuk must be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">“I want to declare that none of the versions - and we have more than 20 today - will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Each version will be diligently checked in accordance with prescribed investigation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">I, as the President, have no possibility to get or must not get any information, which could undermine the course of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the authorities must ensure transparency, and law enforcement institutions must work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only in this way we will be able to learn the truth and punish the evil,” spoke P. Poroshenko in a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He emphasized that he was highly interested that the assassination of K. Handziuk would be cleared up, and killers, organizers and sponsors of the crime “would be held liable”.</seg>
<seg id="8">“After this case was requalified into a murder (case), they are absolutely justly and reasonably under the threat of the life sentence,” the President of Ukraine spoke.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the society was right in requiring an open and unbiased investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">P. Poroshenko pointed out that any statements by representatives of law enforcement authorities in the Parliament should demonstrate that “the authorities are resolved to hold the criminals and murderers liable, whoever they might be”.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also said any political speculations on the subject would not help to solve the situation, but would make it more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I urge all forces, both pro-government and pro-opposition, to spare unfounded arguments and, for God’s sake, not use this murder for public relations,” the President said.</seg>
<seg id="13">- On the contrary, now we must stand united and make sure that the investigation would be efficient, just and transparent, fast - such as to instill trust in the society.</seg>
<seg id="14">We just don’t have any other way.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“No one will be allowed to make use of this situation in order to destabilize the country,” assured he.</seg>
<seg id="16">K. Handziuk, a fighter against corruption, was assaulted in July with sulfuric acid in the city of Kherson.</seg>
<seg id="17">She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.</seg>
<seg id="18">The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the police and public prosecutors failed to find the perpetrators of this attack, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko submitted his statement of resignation on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="20">After her death, government officials were accused by public activists that they were incapable of conducting the investigation properly.</seg>
<seg id="21">The activists also demanded resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Today, I am presenting my statement of resignation,” J. Lutsenko informed members of the Parliament, while reading his investigation report.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Parliament is yet to approve of the resignation of the Prosecutor General.</seg>
<seg id="24">J. Lutsenko accused the activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, therefore it is difficult to find the culprits of K. Handziuk’s murder.</seg>

<seg id="2">Presenting a futurist toilet, Bill Gates compared transfer from the conventional such facilities to those without water supply to the computer revolution in the eighth decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the exhibition in Beijing, Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high tech toilet that does not need water in water supply pipelines, Reuters reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The waterless toilet operates according to the principle of separating hard and liquid waste.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The technologies, that you see here, are the biggest achievements in sanitation in the past 200 years,” Bloomberg quoted Bill Gates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Creation of the technological toilet was funded by the charity fund established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.</seg>
<seg id="8">The work on the facility, which could transform human waste into fertilizers and water, took seven years, the fund spent USD 200 million on this.</seg>
<seg id="9">About 20 toilet models had been created in total, Bill Gates said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, the facility has been finalized and can be offered for sale.</seg>
<seg id="11">But in order to enable mass production of such toilets, the Gates fund is ready to spend 200 million more.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Gates fund, due to poor sanitation, 500,000 children under 5 die in the world each year.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fight against poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, money intended for health care, which already now amounts to 233 billion, is increased.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to better illustrate the sanitation situation, which needs to be improved, Bill Gates took a jar with faeces to the presentation of the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to him, it’s a good reminder that a little sample “could contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs”.</seg>

<seg id="2">French health officials announced on Monday a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide, after alarms were raised because of several dozen people got poisoned in the west of the country recently.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ANSES health security agency said the decision to outlaw all products containing the pesticide metam sodium came after a new safety review launched earlier this year, before at least three outbreaks of poisoning were reported in the Maine-et-Loire department beginning in September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outbreaks had already prompted the government to suspend the use of the pesticide.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground disinfectant is not supposed to come in contact with plants or farm workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The product must be used in high doses to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 700 tonnes of it have been used annually in France.</seg>
<seg id="8">At least 70 people, many of them farm workers, complained of burning eyes and throats, respiratory difficulties in Angers region, where a lot of lamb's lettuce is grown.</seg>
<seg id="9">“These episodes confirm the soundness of our decision, but they did not precipitate it,” Francoise Weber, deputy director at ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Metam sodium - one of the most frequently used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).</seg>
<seg id="11">This pesticide, sold under brand names including Vapam and Sectagon, has been authorized in Europe until 2022, when a new safety review is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="12">“There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, whether or not alternatives exist,” F. Weber told the said paper.</seg>
<seg id="13">“We're aware of the difficulties this will present to lamb's lettuce growers, to farmers in general, but public health comes first,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Farmers had already fumed against the government's suspension last month regarding use of metam sodium in an area, whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="15">This region near Nantes produces more than a half of 35,000 tonnes of lamb's lettuce consumed each year in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">There will be “much less lamb's lettuce, radishes and leeks" available next season, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes growers' federation, told the news agency AFP after the suspension of metam sodium was announced by the government last month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Next weekend, the capital of Estonia opens a new shopping center T1, to which the local capital real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp invested 70 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the developer, the shopping center, the total area of which is 130,000 sq. m and the leasable area is 55,000 sq. m, will host 150 shops, service and entertainment places, over 30 cafes and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">For comparison, the total area of Vilnius Akropolis (including the office premises) is about 110,000 sq. m, with leasable area of 91,000 sq. m.</seg>
<seg id="5">T1 is the first shopping center with the observation wheel on its roof, the developer says.</seg>
<seg id="6">It will start operating at the beginning of next year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Besides, its territory will also integrate an international transport gate: there is a tram stop nearby, long-distance buses will soon be running.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main Rail Baltica terminal is also not far away, it is expected that in about 2026 it will serve 1 million passengers per year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Paolo Michelozzi, the CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that essential shifts are happening in the global business of shopping centers and the developers of T1 managed to find themselves at the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="10">“We have created a new generation shopping center, giving emotions and experience one cannot get online.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a people’s attraction place in the very center of the city, travelers’ gate, an impressive place to be visited that calls for attention and at the same time giving quality time with family and friends,” the press release quotes Mr. Michelozzi’s words.</seg>
<seg id="12">Huge attention to entertainment</seg>

<seg id="14">The total area assigned for entertainment in the object is 12,000 sq. m or a fifth of the total leasable area.</seg>
<seg id="15">An exceptional focus point is an observation wheel on the roof.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will take guests to 120 m above the sea level - only the TV tower is higher in Tallinn.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under the observation wheel, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park Super Skypark, that will open the largest in Europe trampoline center here and the first in Estonia basketball and volleyball courts on trampolines, the company says.</seg>

<seg id="20">In addition to usual movies demonstrated on six screens, visitors will be able to get carried away by virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.</seg>
<seg id="21">Beside visual effects and chairs moving in alignment with the rhythm of a movie, the sense of reality will be reinforced by wind, rain or snow effects, also by specifically chosen smells, smoke or mist in the cinema hall.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the developer, it is expected that opening of T1 will increase Estonia’s tourism income by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.</seg>
<seg id="23">Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic exchange, also on the Frankfurt exchange.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last year, the group earned EUR 1.8 million revenue in Lithuania and suffered a loss of EUR 350,000, the financial statements of Pro Kapital Grupp show.</seg>

<seg id="2">During a ceremony supervised by Cavayé Yéguié Djibril, the President of the National Assembly, the 85-year-old P. Biya promised to safeguard the “integrity and unity” of the Western African state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The oldest president in Africa, ruling its country for already the 35th year, was announced to win the elections held on 7 October with 71 percent of votes.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the elections were marred by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the eve of P. Biya’s inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff members, including the principal, were kidnapped in a Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English speaking separatists pursue an armed campaign for independence.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the 22 million population of Cameroon are French speaking, while one fifth are English speaking.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 2016, in the North West province and in the neighboring South West province, after dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in education, courts and economy, people started demanding autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2017, after P. Biya refused to make concessions, radicals announced an independent state, the “Republic of Ambazonia”, and took weapons.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to non-governmental organizations, in separatist attacks and government’s response operations at least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over 300,000 people fled to escape the violence: some over the border into Nigeria, but most are forced to live from hand-to-mouth in the forests.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the elections in October, mere 5 percent of the electorate voted in the North West region and 15 percent in the South West province.</seg>
<seg id="12">In both the parts of the country, P. Biya had two thirds of votes.</seg>

<seg id="2">“Some things were missing in some places - please understand, the party has organized everything with its own resources.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some municipalities allowed us to use their premises, but not all of them had polling-booths as we cannot acquire them ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="4">We want to thank those who lent them,” the politician said.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, complaints were made, but their content does not change the essence, and the violations themselves were not willful.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Complaints were made.</seg>
<seg id="7">Not everyone taking part in the elections were skilled at it - it was a new experience for them, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, due to lack of experience not all the actions were in line with our procedures.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, the Central Electoral Commission had to give warnings urging to comply with the principles we have described.</seg>
<seg id="10">Those complaints, though, are not a reason to doubt the results,” A. Anušauskas said.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, there were cases when voting ballots were not stamped - having learnt about that, the unstamped voting ballots found in ballot boxes were annulled.</seg>
<seg id="12">In some towns there was not enough space, but, according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations related to only dozens of ballots.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As the difference is several thousands, these ballots really do not make a basic difference for the outcome of the elections,” A. Anušauskas explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is said that the turnout of party members in the elections was 55 percent, meanwhile the turnout of non-party voters was 69 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both the candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in the commissions.</seg>
<seg id="16">The results announced on Sunday do not change, either - the winning Ingrida Šimonytė had 79 percent of votes (16,418 votes), meanwhile Vygaudas Ušackas - 21 percent (4,441 votes).</seg>
<seg id="17">On 17 November, the Council of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats will officially delegate I. Šimonytė as the candidate in the elections for the office of the President of Lithuania to be held in May next year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kęstutis Strupas, former General Manager of the Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, requests to cancel the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (COEC), which admitted that some transactions failed to be declared in time, which constituted a violation of law.</seg>
<seg id="3">K. Strupas’ complaint was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judgement will be announced on 26 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">The applicant requests to cancel the COEC decision of 23 May, BNS was informed by the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.</seg>
<seg id="6">K. Strupas thinks that gifts to close relatives do not have to be declared, he says this is how he understood the exemption from the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">The COEC announced in May that then removed General Manager of Santaros Klinikos K. Strupas and Silvija Strupienė, the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, violated provisions of the law regulating declaration of private interests.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was found during the investigation that four transactions failed to be declared in time: a bank loan taken with the spouse in 2010, acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift (apartment) given to the daughter in 2017 and a loan given with the spouse to a natural person in 1996, which was not repaid.</seg>
<seg id="9">S. Strupienė declared these transactions late, too.</seg>
<seg id="10">Persons, having breached the Law on the Adjustment of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service, cannot be given incentives for a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Law orders to declare not only one’s own but also spouse’s data.</seg>
<seg id="12">The COEC performed the investigation referring to the information on Info TV.</seg>
<seg id="13">It examined whether K. Strupas and his spouse S. Strupienė, the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, declared their transactions properly and in time.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Info TV announced, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real property as a gift, the value of which was EUR 125,000.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the former head of Santaros Klinikos and his wife had not indicated such data in their declarations of interests.</seg>
<seg id="16">Law enforcement authorities have suspected K. Strupas and at least ten more persons of corruption - according to the authorities, for winning of computer, software public procurements in the hospital, illegal financial payoff was requested from companies, it was disguised as sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is suspected that K. Strupas made such agreements for at least five times, when Santaros Klinikos was performing public procurements in the area of information technologies.</seg>
<seg id="18">K. Strupas denies the accusations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Under suspicion of corruption, Prof. K. Strupas was dismissed from the office of the head of Santaros Klinikos in September.</seg>
<seg id="20">By a decision of Santaros Klinikos stakeholders the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, the employment relationship with K. Strupas was terminated on his own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had been the head of the hospital since 10 November 2013.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, the temporary head of Santaros Klinikos is Prof. Juozas Raistenskis until a new General Manager is elected by way of a competition, which is to be announced this year already.</seg>

<seg id="3">Jurgita Petrauskienė, the Minister of Education and Science, who spoke during the discussion, said that over EUR 30 million had been invested into education content update in the recent ten years, however, no results are visible.</seg>
<seg id="4">“According to the results of the international student assessment PISA, our school students’ achievements are below the average of the OECD countries,” the Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report of the Ministry of Education and Science quotes the OECD expert Phil Lambert, who noted that Lithuania was too much focused on giving knowledge rather than practical application of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to him, Lithuanian general education curricula focus a lot on developing students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, however, there is lack of focus on developing children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gražvydas Kazakevičius, the Vice-minister of Education and Science, presenting changes in general education content, stated that the curricula, updating of which is started this academic year, will decrease in scope, will be more specific, the study subjects will be more interrelated.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Vice-minister, students’ education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare 10 to 30 percent of their unique education content, the current students’ assessment system will transform into the cumulative point, students’ competences acquired informally will gain more weight.</seg>
<seg id="9">There will be less of standardized tests.</seg>
<seg id="10">The promise is that the general education curricula will be digital, user friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.</seg>
<seg id="11">The update of the education content is aimed at having students’ achievements in the international PISA assessment improve at least by 10 percent, the gap between students’ achievements decrease by a third, students acquire modern competences, versatile literacies in school.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million of the European Union funds and funds from the state budget for updating the education content from May 2018.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is expected that the project of the updated general education curricula will be tested in some schools in the academic year 2019-2020, and their implementation will start in all the schools since September 2021.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the beginning of October, the Ministry was criticized about the project of almost EUR 8 million carried out by the Education Development Centre, which is intended for updating the general curricula for elementary, medium and secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="15">EUR 7.8 million is intended to be allocated for this purpose over the period of four years, the first procurement for EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October in search for education curricula drafters.</seg>
<seg id="16">As experts have criticized this procurement, it was suspended, the Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskienė fired Giedrius Vaidelis, the Director of the Education Development Centre.</seg>

<seg id="1">Training in Lithuania on how to react to an extreme flood</seg>
<seg id="2">On Monday, a ten days training will start in Lithuania for improving the institutions’ reaction to an extreme flood.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the Fire and Rescue Department (FRD) informed, the training will allow to check how state institutions are ready to work when an emergency of national level is announced in the country, for example, a flood: to liquidate its consequences, to coordinate search for and rescue of people and urgent evacuation from flooded areas, to organize provision with drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary power supply and to provide other measures for protection of people.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 100 representatives from all the ministries, other institutions of the country will take part in the training, as well as members of centers for emergency operations from 12 municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="5">On 5-13 November, the preparatory stage of the training will be performed, during which the municipalities, having received the Hydrometeorological Service information from the FRD about persistent precipitation and starting flood, will take decisions on the emergency management.</seg>
<seg id="6">The active phase of the training is planned for 14-15 November.</seg>
<seg id="7">During it, the National Center for Emergency Operations will operate in the Department, whereas institutional centers for emergency operations will operate in state and municipal institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the Government announces an emergency of national level due to flood, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the liquidation of the emergency, elimination of its consequences, actions of protection and rescue of people and assets.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of the FRD, says that the most important thing in the training is to check readiness of institutions to perform functions provided for in legal acts, to assess information exchange possibilities, to check readiness to warn and inform people, state and municipal institutions, bodies and companies about the calamity threat and “to improve state institutions’ emergency management skills”.</seg>
<seg id="10">The training will also be an opportunity for demonstrating joint capacities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonians firefighters-rescuers to pump huge volumes of water from flooded areas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Module "BaltFloodCombat" was established in 2009 for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, speaking in the parliament of the country, announced his resignation amid public outrage over the death of anti-corruption activist Kateryna Handziuk, who suffered an acid attack, as published by the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Ukrainian laws, the Prosecutor General must submit a statement of resignation to the President of the country and the latter must present it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by the majority of votes.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General J. Lutsenko presented the course and results of the investigation of ordering K. Handziuk’s assassination, as carried out by law enforcement authorities, before the Verkhovna Rada.</seg>
<seg id="5">In his speech to the members of the Verkhovna Rada, he described the investigation as efficient, but he expressed his indignation that K. Handziuk’s death was used for politician’s public relations.</seg>
<seg id="6">K. Handziuk was a Ukrainian activist, fighter against corruption, who openly spoke about the police corruption in her native city of Kherson in the south of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="7">On 31 July, an unknown attacker spilled acid on K. Handziuk’s face near her home.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 4 November, she died in hospital as a result of the suffered injuries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Protesters by the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine demand an answer who murdered K. Handziuk, AFP/Scanpix photo</seg>
<seg id="10">According to J. Lutsenko, the investigation carried out by law enforcement authorities mentions 12 persons possibly related to ordering the murder of K. Handziuk.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, one of the most probable versions of the investigation was leaked to mass media, which is a threat for the success of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Prosecutor General, the information leakage provided suspects with knowledge essential for them.</seg>
<seg id="13">J. Lutsenko added that he personally knew K. Handziuk and he was indignant that some politicians used her blood for public relations.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In order that no one would have a pretext to say that someone clings to power, I want to declare that I am submitting my letter of resignation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Today, I will submit it to the President of Ukraine and you will need to consider this issue in the Rada,” J. Lutsenko’s speech in the Rada was quoted by the publication Obozrevatel.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is written that J. Lutsenko added that "he cannot permit the diarchy in the country, when the law enforcement system is ruined without any evidence, even for revealed crimes".</seg>
<seg id="17">J. Lutsenko is regarded to be a close comrade of the country’s President Petro Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after a prolonged attempt to remove this predecessor Viktor Shokin, who had been suspected of covering corruption of top level officials and politicians.</seg>

<seg id="2">As Elta was informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, advisor to the Minister of Energy, in the meeting they will talk about achievement of renewable energy sources targets in the transport sector until 2020 and after 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector which is currently below the trajectories determined in the aggregated National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP) at EU level, with a 6 % share of renewable energy sources in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="4">The EC holds that a rather slow progress to the mandatory 10% target in transport is due to various difficulties including relatively high greenhouse gas mitigation costs and regulatory uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="5">Renewable energy in this sector comes largely from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a more limited role at this stage.</seg>

<seg id="12">They say that the former Chairman of the Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities in the Seimas could have instructed the COEC members to dismiss Mindaugas Siaurys, the former head of the Prevention Division of the COEC.</seg>

<seg id="1">Plump girls defeat wedding dress stereotypes</seg>
<seg id="2">A plump girl in a white puffy wedding dress - mission (im)possible?</seg>
<seg id="3">Can a white swan swimming down the aisle be larger than size S or M and still look attractive?</seg>
<seg id="4">Participants of the plus-size reality show "Size (r)evolution" will prove already today that beauty and elegance of a bride do not really depend on the woman’s weight.</seg>
<seg id="5">But that is not everything - one of the girls in the project will shed tears of happiness - her boyfriend will show up on the shooting scene.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Still there are people who think that bigger girls do not get boys’ attention or glances.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is only a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes me as I am, he does not require some standard body shape from me," the show participant Aurika would say before appearing in a wedding dress.</seg>
<seg id="8">A wedding dress is not an easy outfit, in all senses of the word - it is a complicated structure, with a lot of fabric, the dress is heavy, not comfortable to move in.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some women also think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and, therefore, will be less self-confident.</seg>
<seg id="10">I can assure you that a properly selected model of a dress really solves this ‘problem’," explained one of the show commission members, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.</seg>
<seg id="11">The girls’ fate in the project is decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the rest of the commission - Erika Vitulskienė, who opened a plus-size fashion house, the photographer and social media star Naglis Bierancas and TV producer Laura Paukštė.</seg>
<seg id="12">"When we, the commission members, have to select a girl to leave the show, we have lots of arguments - one way or another, we represent different spheres and have different perceptions of the future winner of the show.</seg>
<seg id="13">The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was also made harder by the fact - I can already reveal it now - that two new girls arrived, who really were no worse than the veterans of the show.</seg>
<seg id="14">The evening was special in all senses,” R. Kalinkinas says.</seg>
<seg id="15">The newly arrived girls - 23-year-old Ieva known by her scandalous behavior in a summer reality show and 31-year-old Dovilė, a mom of two kids of exceptional beauty - participated in the casting for "Size (r)evolution" as other girls and were among the best twenty.</seg>
<seg id="16">Unfortunately, after the first very open photo sessions of the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.</seg>
<seg id="17">The girls were returned to the show by LNK audience who voted for their favorites on the portal of this TV channel.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reality show of plump beauties, which has international recognition, has been going on in Lithuania for the second week already - the plus-size girls compete here for the title of the first plus-size star in the country.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eight girls remain so far, and all of them understand perfectly well that only one can be the winner.</seg>
<seg id="20">An intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r)evolution" starts already this Monday evening at 20:30 on LNK.</seg>

<seg id="3">The ruling parties do not seek any more that 20 km distance to settlements be kept in case of construction of waste-to-energy power plants.</seg>
<seg id="4">“Farmer” Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Committee on Environmental Protection, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas on Monday, refusing such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Mr. Mažeika, the “farmers’” faction, that previously supported the provision regarding the distance of 20 km, now is going to support the amendment for its cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The amendment registered by Mr. Mažeika provides that from January 2019 waste-to-energy power plants could be constructed in accordance with statutory requirements for environmental protection and protection of public health.</seg>
<seg id="7">He admits that the amendments are proposed with regard to the President’s doubts regarding such a ban.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Taking into account the definition of a residential territory, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find a place where the said objects could be constructed,” the chairman of the committee says.</seg>
<seg id="9">In October, the ruling majority opposed the President’s veto on the amendments making requirements for construction of waste-to-energy power plants stricter.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to the ban to construct waste-to-energy power plants at less than 20 km distance to settlements, the amendments gave the Government permission to take decisions regarding the future of the two plants already under construction, with regard to public health interests.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Mažeika does not propose to amend this provision.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the fraught issue of Northern Ireland, which is holding up Brexit talks, Dublin said.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a phone call, the British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the possibility to review the so-called mechanism for backstop arrangement intended to keep an open border between British Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a Member State of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar indicated he would consider the idea, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally pull out of the arrangement, according to a statement issued by the Irish Government.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the call, Th. May “raised the possibility to review a mechanism for the backstop”, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Varadkar indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop,” the Government statement said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Brexit talks are stalled over how to avoid frontier checks on the British and Irish land border, when Britain leaves the single market and the customs union in March next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both sides agree to a “backstop” to keep the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until they strike a wider trade deal to avoid additional customs checks on the border.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to follow the EU customs rules, but London wants the whole of the UK to stay temporarily aligned.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing for Britain to be able to pull out of the backstop arrangement unilaterally after three months.</seg>
<seg id="11">But L. Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government “can’t countenance” this.</seg>
<seg id="12">“A backstop with a three-month limit on it or expiry date of that nature isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” he declared.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, both London and Brussels played down suggestions of a breakthrough in the Brexit talks, after a weekend report in Britain suggesting a deal was close.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I would say that we continue to make good progress in the negotiations, but there’s still work to do,” said Th. May’s spokesman in London.</seg>
<seg id="15">The European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: “We’re not there yet.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Seimas approved bigger fines for harmful products</seg>
<seg id="2">Seimas approved of amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.</seg>
<seg id="3">The amendments were voted in favor of unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said speaking about the new draft, the fact that the amendments aim at better protection of product consumers is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besides, its provisions are in line with the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I think that the proposed draft law makes a more perfect and more specific distribution among all participants of the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.</seg>
<seg id="7">The practice shows that the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, as entities, having paid fines, continue committing repeated violations,” A. Vinkus spoke.</seg>
<seg id="8">The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy; after the Government’s approval, the Seimas Committee on Economics added its own proposals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The amendments to the Law are aimed at increasing fines for violations, raising protection of consumer rights, giving more power to market supervisory authorities and creating a clear system of requirements for product safety and supervision over their compliance.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the Ministry of Economy, currently manufacturers are not subject to the obligation to label a product properly and thus to ensure its traceability.</seg>
<seg id="11">Besides, according to the ministry, the market supervisory authorities, which perform state control over safety of products, do not have the right to enter manufacturers’ and suppliers’ territory, buildings, premises, to perform inspections, which hinders the work of the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministry holds that the current term of six months for imposition on fines and giving of warnings is too short for identifying a violation, making an investigation and imposing a fine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also, according to the ministry, the current fines are not efficient enough.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies often repeatedly breach requirements of the law - in 2017 only it was done by 14 companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Ministry of Economy proposed to establish a duty for manufacturers to properly label a product and thus to ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market supervisory authorities to reveal suppliers of non-compliant products.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is also proposed that market supervisory authorities, in performance of state control over product safety, would have the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises of the entities that produce, supply products to the market, to perform inspections.</seg>
<seg id="17">The amounts of fines for violations of the law are going to be increased.</seg>
<seg id="18">A manufacturer, importer or authorized representative that placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor that supplied them to the market, a service provider who provided or provides dangerous services would be subject to a fine of EUR 150 to 2,500 (currently, a fine of EUR 144 to 1,448).</seg>
<seg id="19">If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (SCRPA) or another market supervisory authority decides to prohibit placement and supply of dangerous products on / to the market or provision of dangerous services, a fine of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (currently, EUR 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.</seg>
<seg id="20">In case of failure to fulfil the demand to remove dangerous products from the market, to recall them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 6,500 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 5,792) would be imposed.</seg>
<seg id="21">If dangerous products caused harm to consumer’s health, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 15,000 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 11,584) would be imposed.</seg>
<seg id="22">If dangerous products caused consumer’s death, a fine of EUR 6,500 to 25,000 (currently, EUR 5,792 to 23,169) would be imposed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the ministry, in Poland and Austria a violation of legal acts on product safety is subject to a fine of up to EUR 25,000 (the minimal amount of the fine is not set), in Belgium - a fine of EUR 26 to 600,000, in Romania - a fine of EUR 155 to 6,666, in Bulgaria - a fine of EUR 125 to 7,500.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kaunas citizens, seeing workers busy in the Kaunas Castle, have hoped that finally the restoration of the remaining tower has been started.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, the Director of the Kaunas City Museum, explained to the portal kauno.diena.lt that these were operations for replacement of the cover of protective shelters of the Southwest tower with a defense wall fragment.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the shelters would be made of tin.</seg>
<seg id="5">“The worn-out wreck tin cover was a threat - people could fall in and get hurt - so it was necessary to replace it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The shelters were not humidity resistant, so the heritage suffered, too,” the museum director explained.</seg>
<seg id="7">Will these shelters be similar to those that existed several centuries ago?</seg>
<seg id="8">“All works have been coordinated with heritage and other authorities,” G. Sužeidėlis added that they were seeking as authentic result as possible, but the practical aspect was also important - the shelters were to shield the heritage against humidity.</seg>
<seg id="9">A universal solution was made in cooperation with heritage authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Previously, the Kaunas Castle elements were tinned in Soviet times, which means that they did not have historic value as such,” the Director of the Kaunas City Museum went to details.</seg>
<seg id="11">The contract for works was signed on 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The works are not to take more than 3 months after the contract was signed.</seg>
<seg id="13">“We expect them to be completed by the end of November,” the museum director voiced his expectations.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said that the value of the works to be performed was almost EUR 24,000.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to him, this amount was in this year’s budget.</seg>

<seg id="5">I am certain we will find space for such actions, as the topics of the NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries we happen to analyze are priority topics for them, too,” Kojala said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agreements say that the EESC and the US institutions will work together in preparing applications for international projects, will exchange expert experience and knowledge, experts’ visits will be organized.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is expected to be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts as both partners have outstanding international reputation.</seg>
