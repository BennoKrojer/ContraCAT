<seg id="4">According to Daily Mail, Hunt’s comment concerned the difficulties in Brexit talks.</seg>
<seg id="5">“What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Union was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won't diminish, it will grow. We won’t be the only prisoner willing to escape the trap,” claimed the minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave EU just make the crisis more severe, notes Gazeta.Ru.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the middle of September, the British prime minister Theresa May claimed that Brexit talks are stuck.’</seg>
<seg id="10">This is how she commented on informal EU summit in Salzburg.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Brexit decision was taken in 2016 following the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="12">The UK is expected to quit EU until April 2019, but the talks with Brussels on this issue faced a lot of difficult issues.</seg>
<seg id="13">In particular, there’s still no agreement on how the parties are going to interact after London leaves the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also, the question about the Irish border remains open.</seg>

<seg id="8">They account for about 35 percent of the volume of financial takings.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bob Hartley: I am happy for our players who took advantage of the power play in the match against Dinamo Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Avangard head coach Bob Hartley summed up the KHL regular season game against Dinamo Minsk (2:1).</seg>
<seg id="4">"It was a very important victory for us.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave this game behind us and prepare for Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="6">We knew that Dinamo had enjoyed a big victory before our game, so we prepared for it very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was important to attack during the power play. I am happy for our players who took advantage of the power play.</seg>
<seg id="8">Recently, we have played well during power plays, but have not been able to score.</seg>
<seg id="9">And at last the red light behind the goal lit up.</seg>
<seg id="10">We knew that Minsk would come out locked and loaded and ready to put their best face forward, and that’s how it turned out.</seg>
<seg id="11">The part of the game with a power play was decisive; we scored the winning goal during a power play.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a good third period today, despite the fact that we let in an early goal in the period and it was clear that it would not be easy.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we played very well in defense, restricted the opponent to few chances, did not allow them to catch us out during substitutions. Dinamo did not have any power plays, so the game ended well for us", said Hartley, as reported by the Omsk press office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Elon Musk was forced to leave his post as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla</seg>
<seg id="2">The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Tesla founder Elon Musk settled their dispute over a fraud case.</seg>
<seg id="3">CNBC News reports on this.</seg>
<seg id="4">The TV network reports that under the agreement reached, Musk must leave his post as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The SEC allowed Musk to still retain his post as chief executive of Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tesla founder must also pay an administrative fine in the amount of $20 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">The same amount will also be collected from Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="8">The money will be distributed among investors who were harmed.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.</seg>
<seg id="10">Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 wealthiest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is the head of the space company SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink, and creator of the electric-car company Tesla, as well as founder of Paypal.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SEC previously brought a case against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk for his announcement posted on Twitter of a possible buyout of the company.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last month Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy out all its shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.</seg>
<seg id="14">The $420 share price was supposedly set “due to the significance of this number in marijuana culture,” the Bloomberg news agency earlier reported with a quote by Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s security department.</seg>
<seg id="15">Elon Musk consequently dropped his plans to buy up the shares.</seg>
<seg id="16">Commenting on the court case brought against him by the SEC, the businessman stated that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn’t violate it at all,” said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile in August a group of Tesla shareholders brought a class-action lawsuit against Musk complaining of financial losses that they had incurred.</seg>
<seg id="19">The plaintiffs asserted that Musk’s posts resulted in losses for them.</seg>
<seg id="20">In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the tweets from Musk led to mistakes whereby sellers of Tesla shares were forced to purchase securities at artificially high prices in order to cover their positions.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other plaintiffs also pointed out that careless statements by Elon Musk caused sharp fluctuations in the share price.</seg>
<seg id="22">In September Musk was accused of market manipulation also by the head of Citron Research.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meanwhile, if Musk hadn’t been able to settle his case with the SEC, he could have faced removal from the company’s management and even prison.</seg>
<seg id="24">Former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt told CNBC about this.</seg>
<seg id="25">Musk is “not a bad guy, but he’s not capable of managing a car company.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Grand prix in Sochi: tickets sold out, Russian race car and return of Kvyat</seg>
<seg id="2">In ten years, Russia could have it’s own race car.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's vice premier minister Dmitry Kozak has announced this while recounting his meeting with Russian car manufacturers before the Russian gran prix start in Sochi.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also, the vice premier minister shared his opinion about Daniil Kvyat’s return to “Toro Rosso” and approved the popularity of the Russian stage of “Formula-1”.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our meeting with car producers should result in creating a Russian car for Formula-1 in the nearest future which would have no analogs in the world, said Kozak.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have to motivate our car producers to work in this direction.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was planned to happen by 2024 but I don’t think it’s possible in such a short term.</seg>
<seg id="8">I think a more realistic time-frame would be within the netx 10 years.”</seg>
<seg id="9">From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team participated in Formula-1 under the Russian license.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the vice premier minister, some investors are already ready to invest in the creation of a team for the Formula-1 World Championship’s.</seg>
<seg id="11">I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sports, affluent businessmen, who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of a Russian Formula-1 team, he noted.</seg>
<seg id="12">“We are ready to support their efforts.</seg>
<seg id="13">We hope that such team will make its appearance.</seg>
<seg id="14">I suspect that the idea to create such a team appeared in part due to the appearance of new infrastructure in Sochi”.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tomorrow, “Sochi Autodrom” is sold out,´.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Dmitry Kozak, the organisers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.</seg>
<seg id="17">Look, even for the qualifying rounds the tribunes were full, said the vice prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can say that profits this year have by 72% compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's good, it's a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also, we a preparing a plan to improve the “Sochi avtodrom” effectivity during the year.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will be an additional tourist product, that will make Sochi even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dmitry Kozal also touched the main topic for Russian car race fans - return of Daniil Kvyat in “Toro Rosso”.</seg>
<seg id="23">We all congratulate Daniil and wish him success in the next season, said vice minister to “Izvestia”.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is a promising car racer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Next year, first time in history two main pilots from Russia will take part in Formula-1.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although, Sergey Sirotkin’s future in the “King’s races” is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="27">His contract with “Williams” is until the end of season, but the results aren’t striking: he took the 18th place in the Russian grand prix qualification.</seg>
<seg id="28">We’ll hope that in the next season there will be more main pilots from Russia then this year, claimed Kozak.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Golden Pearl" for "ultimate realism"</seg>
<seg id="2">For the third time in history, the International film festival in San Sebastian recognized a Spanish film as the best film of the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The main award - the "Golden Shell" - was awarded to the drama "Between the Two Waters", directed by Isaki Lacuesta.</seg>
<seg id="4">This film, which has an almost documentary realism, depicts the difficult story of the life of two brothers in the Spanish coastal province of Cadiz - Lacuesta presented the continuation of his 2006 film "The Legend of Time".</seg>
<seg id="5">At the award ceremony of the film festival in San Sebastian, the producers of the Argentine thriller "Red" were recognized, and the film was named in several categories at once.</seg>
<seg id="6">Benjamin Naishtat was declared the director of the year, Pedro Sotero was awarded for his camera work, and Dario Grandinetti was recognized as the best actor.</seg>
<seg id="7">The actress of the year at the film festival in San Sebastian was Pia Tjelta from Norway.</seg>
<seg id="8">The jury praised her participation in the film "Blind Spot" - this is a drama about the life of one family after a daughter's suicide attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">The film was the directorial debut of the Swedish actress Tuva Novotny.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the Best Script category , victory was shared by the films "Yuli" and "A Faithful Man".</seg>
<seg id="11">A special jury prize was awarded to the Philippine crime drama "Alpha: The Right to Kill".</seg>
<seg id="12">Dizziness, tears and laughter</seg>
<seg id="13">The festival in San Sebastian is referred to as one of the main cultural events in Spain and one of the most important European film contests.</seg>
<seg id="14">The winner of the "Golden Shell" director Isaki Lacuesta talked to Euronews about his impressions of the festival:</seg>
<seg id="15">It was wonderful!</seg>
<seg id="16">We came here with the whole team, and of course we experienced dizzying moments, tears, and laughter.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are happy.</seg>
<seg id="18">We started making this film 14 years ago, it was really a lot of work, and what was especially important for me is that we did not want to stop.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now is the time for joy and gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Euronews correspondent Carlos Marlaska notes, the film by Isaki Lacuesta fits well into the collection of films that received "Golden Shells", but the festival in San Sebastian did not pass without unexpected, at times shocking jury decisions that are sometimes called the hallmark of the competition".</seg>

<seg id="1">On September 30, 1928, i.e., exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.</seg>
<seg id="2">The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him the Nobel laureate.</seg>
<seg id="3">By the way, the isolation of penicillin from mold fungi was not the first discovery of Fleming.</seg>
<seg id="4">A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he placed mucus from his own nose on a Petri dish (this is a kind of a glass dish in which experiments are conducted with bacteria) and a few days later he discovered that the bacteria that was there had been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Penicillin was also discovered by chance in almost the same way.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in human history.</seg>
<seg id="7">His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the help of penicillin, medicine began to beat the most longstanding diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...</seg>
<seg id="9">When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, Paris newspapers wrote: “He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".</seg>
<seg id="10">According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world's first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.</seg>
<seg id="13">Where, by the way, a talkative Russian-speaking guide drew the attention of me and my wife to it.</seg>
<seg id="14">And a few years later, we had a chance to see Alexander Fleming's full size statue in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.</seg>
<seg id="15">There, near the main bullfighting arena Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man, whose efforts, in their opinion, saved the lives of hundreds of eminent bullfighters.</seg>
<seg id="16">By the way, I found this very interesting, in my opinion, porcelain work at the same place, in Madrid, but at another time and for a completely different reason.</seg>

<seg id="3">There were reports that aspirin does not protect during primary prevention in people at low risk of heart and vascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professionals already know this.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it effectively protects against heart attacks and strokes during primary prevention in people at high risk of cardiovascular diseases, and in patients with coronary heart disease or other manifestations of atherosclerosis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump spoke of “being in love” with Kim Jong-un</seg>
<seg id="2">While earlier they had bullied each other, the leaders of the US and North Korea have practically fallen in love, joked Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump reported a well-executed joke about their successes in resolving the North Korea crisis.</seg>
<seg id="4">After starting with mutual threats of annihilation, now the leaders of the two countries have smoothed out their relations so well that they are virtually in love with each other, the American President remarked.</seg>
<seg id="5">The man in the White House mentioned that he had taken on the North Korea problem from the previous administration as the most difficult problem in foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump notes that Barack Obama’s team had so neglected relations with North Korea that it couldn’t even reach the country’s leadership by phone — the other side basically didn’t pick up the receiver.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, but today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trump admitted that he had been “nasty” to Kim Jong-un, which, by the way, was mutual.</seg>
<seg id="9">But now their relations have been smoothed out to the point that the leaders “have fallen in love with each other.”</seg>
<seg id="10">Trump meanwhile asked people not to take his words literally and warned that American media will interpret his statements as incompetence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump pointed out that recently Pyongyang had stopped its nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military bases.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American president is sure that all of this is the achievement of his administration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Tuesday Donald Trump spoke flatteringly of Kim Jong-un at a meeting of the UN’s General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his bravery and for the steps he has taken to de-escalate tensions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump also noted that sanctions against North Korea are being kept in place until the moment of full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="16">Negotiations in Singapore</seg>
<seg id="17">On the 12th of June in Singapore, the first negotiations in history took place between leaders of the US and North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="18">After a significant worsening in relations and mutual threats to use nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a breakthrough in the protracted North-Korean/American crisis.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of the negotiations, the two sides expressed the intention to move in the direction of a peaceful resolution of the conflict, while not taking on any legal obligations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Positive results from the meeting were the suspension of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, as well as the return to the US of the remains of American soldiers from that country.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the same time, no other practical steps toward the denuclearization of North Korea are being taken.</seg>
<seg id="22">News media have reported that after the Singapore summit, the US sent several scenarios for disarmament to North Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangster-like.”</seg>

<seg id="2">Ukrainian children's author and advocate for the purity of her native language, Larisa Nitsoi called for relieving Ukraine from the "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language."</seg>
<seg id="3">To do this, she proposes as the Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nitsoi shared her thoughts on "the feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observer".</seg>
<seg id="5">In her words, the right Ukrainian product is ready now - it already exists and will continue to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="6">With time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she asserted.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, in neighboring Poland, in her words, Russian speech was widespread on television and radio, but it was practically absent in the public arena.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this regard, in Nitsoi's opinion, Ukrainians are not using aggressive methods in this process: actions by authorities to prohibit the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, merely "expand the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at a legal level."</seg>
<seg id="9">Previously, Nitsoi shared her experience supporting a "Ukrainian language regime" at a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.</seg>
<seg id="10">In December 2016 she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, one of whose cashiers spoke to her in Russian.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nitsoi lost her temper and threw her change at the young woman.</seg>
<seg id="12">She called Ukrainians' use of Russian words "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to refrain from using Russian letters even when writing last names.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recently Nitsoi announced that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, and thus Russia should be referred to as Muscovy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not evade the writer's wrath: having visited there and overheard conversations among coworkers in Russian, she started a scandal and absconded, slamming the door.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four incidents associated with violations of electoral law have been registered in the Republic of Macedonia during a referendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece about renaming.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was reported on Sunday by press secretary of the Interior Ministry Toni Angelovski.</seg>
<seg id="4">From the moment that polling stations opened four incidents were registered, which were eliminated," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">At a polling station in the Lazo Angelovski elementary school in Skopje, 22-year-old K.Zh. violated public order and peace, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was detained and taken to a police station.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Interior Ministry representative, all offenders were promptly taken to police stations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ministry noted that in all irregularities were being checked.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The ministry will act in accordance with the law, so that citizens can peacefully use their constitutional right to freely express their will.</seg>
<seg id="10">We call on citizens to observe laws and refrain from any violations of public order and peace and any violations of electoral secrecy," said the Interior Ministry representative.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the referendum on Sunday citizens were invited to answer one question: "Do you support membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"</seg>
<seg id="12">The referendum is aimed at settling a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece about the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of a northern Greek region.</seg>
<seg id="13">At an official ceremony on 17 June on the bank of Lake Prespa, through which the border between the two countries passes, the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the official name of the former Yugoslav republic.</seg>
<seg id="14">It envisages the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".</seg>
<seg id="15">This agreement should solve not only the many-year dispute about the name of the country, but also open a path into NATO and the EU for Skopje.</seg>

<seg id="1">Accusations were news for Dagestani deputy</seg>
<seg id="2">The Sovetsky regional court of Makhachkala remanded in custody for two months the deputy of the People's Assembly Radzhab Abdulatipov, suspected of participating in a criminal organisation that documented disability status for bribes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kommersant learned the details of materials of the investigation, shedding light on how, exactly, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramzan Abdulatipov, Radzhab Abdulatipov aided the criminal activity of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among other things, in the course of the criminal intelligence and surveillance operations conducted by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Radzhab Abdulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the position of head of the bureau, allegedly having received for this 70 mln rub.</seg>
<seg id="5">Recall that earlier, in relation to Magomed Makhachev, other managers and employees of territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise subordinate to him, the investigation opened a criminal case under art. 210 (creation of a criminal organization with the use of professional position and participation in it), art. 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), art. 292 (forgery by an official) and art. 159 (large scale fraud) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="6">As follows from the case materials, at the end of 2013 Radzhab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in the theft of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities, having entered the criminal organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">Holding the post of head of the directorate of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Dagestan and having connections with governmental authorities and law enforcement structures, and also using his familial relationship with the leader of Dagestan, Radzhab Adulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activity of other participants of the criminal organization, established contacts with officials of governmental bodies for the support of the illegal activity of Magomed Makhachev and his holding of the position of head of the federal state-funded institution 'Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise of the Republic of Dagestan', organized the illegal confirmation of disability status of citizens".</seg>
<seg id="8">After disclosure of this information at the meeting of the Sovetsky regional court on Friday Radzhab Abdulatipov denied the accusations against him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Of course, all, that today is brought on me in the form of an accusation, to me it is all new, I am completely unaware of it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for 10 days before bringing charges, as was with previous high-ranking Dagestani bureaucrats, but immediately for two months, since the case includes art. 210 of the Russian Criminal Code.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Criminal Procedure Code, for bringing charges the investigation has much more time – up to 45 days from the moment of detention.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Serbian leader made this statement during a press conference, as reported by the local newspaper Vechernye Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that when speaking of the need for Russian support, he does not mean military support as in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absent</seg>
<seg id="2">The head of the Federation Council committee on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers that the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly was successful for Russia and does not exclude that it could become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetoric, to which we had already almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.</seg>
<seg id="4">He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimes "referred to as one of the three main threats to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or climate change or terrorism, Russia was among these, in any case, in the narrative of a group of western countries, which on this account spoke out quite unanimously".</seg>
<seg id="5">At the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, "the subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absent".</seg>
<seg id="6">"If one carefully analyses the speech of the president of USA, the president of France, the speech of the foreign minister of Germany, I'm not now taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, there was certainly no choir," the politician pointed out, noting that Russia "is no longer a kind of wall on which to practise hitting a tennis ball".</seg>
<seg id="7">The head of the Federation Council committee does not exclude that this indicates a kind of tendency which, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this tendency may only fully manifest itself in a year, in two, three".</seg>
<seg id="8">"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with the inclusion of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs".</seg>
<seg id="9">As an example he gave the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="10">"At the moment, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that in time the Russian view on the Ukrainian crisis will also be sought," the parliamentarian added.</seg>
<seg id="11">He supposes that this is connected with the appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia as not just a possible but integral participant in the solution of global problems of our time."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeling that we will pass the point somewhere beyond which movement will not be backwards, it will be movement forwards," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">One other "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev said was the "demand for the Russian view of how the modern world should develop".</seg>
<seg id="14">"I was present at a great many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and with great pleasure I saw that while one-two years or five years ago on the whole nobody was interested in the Russian opinion, the Russian view of what is happening in the world, now the situation is different," said the chair of the Federation Council committee.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, this is due to how "the so-called new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve international problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration".</seg>
<seg id="16">"And now the demand for the Russian view is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said with certainty, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".</seg>

<seg id="1">The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who was convicted in the Russian Federation for "espionage", for not being able to release him from the dungeons.</seg>
<seg id="2">She said this in a video message to the political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to her, during these days a protest is being held at the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, whose participants have declared a hunger strike, while demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="4">Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, are fasting in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, in which the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, we all, have not demanded that pressure is put on the Kremlin, that pressure is put on Putin, with one demand - Oleg’s release, Roman’s release, the release of the political prisoners of the Kremlin and the people who are being illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Gerashchenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">She also expressed confidence that these hardships will toughen up every Ukrainian, making us "angrier, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".</seg>
<seg id="7">We remind you that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was detained by the Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at a Moscow airport.</seg>
<seg id="8">On October 7, he was charged with spying for the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="9">On June 4, 2018, the Moscow city court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a penal colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict lawful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Russian jailers granted a last request to the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.</seg>

<seg id="10">I was admitted to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="11">There I could not hold a spoon, could not stand, and fell over all the time.</seg>
<seg id="12">They began to do tests, and the resuls turned out to be bad, the artery was not allowing the flow of blood.</seg>
<seg id="13">They took me to Moscow, and there they said that there was a large purulent cyst in my head, and they did an urgent operation.</seg>

<seg id="6">As part of the general sexual education of children, this must be done, explaining the harm, because here there is a risk specific to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.</seg>
<seg id="7">The problem is objective, it lies in the fact that children reach puberty quite early, and then a large discrepancy appears between their puberty and ability to officially enter into intersexual contact.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Onishchenko, "prudishness", the hushing up of "problems of a sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate parenting are preventing a solution to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doctor is sure that many teenagers encounter masturbation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The deputy believes that the provision of lessons about the dangers of masturbation is most of all worth it in the schools of "hyper-urbanized" regions.</seg>

<seg id="1">AfD is now second by popularity in Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” party set a new record for popularity, while Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.</seg>
<seg id="3">By all accounts, Germany’s residents have started to seriously tire of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desired destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clearest of all on this matter are the latest opinion polls: Alternative for Germany keeps getting more popular, while the positions of Merkel and Seehofer, who head the two allied governing parties, are weakening.</seg>
<seg id="5">This week the AfD set its latest record, rising to second place in popular preferences.</seg>
<seg id="6">At 17%, the conservatives have managed to stay ahead of the social democrats, who have about 16%.</seg>
<seg id="7">A gap of one percentage point could be attributed to statistical error, but the fact still must be noted that the AfD, which was established in 2013 out of a small group of economists and eurosceptics, was able to turn into a serious political force.</seg>
<seg id="8">Leading in overall standing is still the CDU/CSU union of parties, which has about 30%.</seg>
<seg id="9">But a falling trend is still observed: In April, support for Angela Merkel’s union of parties was still four percentage points higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">The German chancellor’s personal rating is falling, while she is leading the government for a fourth term in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11">Support now for Angela Merkel stands at 48%, which is 7% lower than last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">We should add that after the Social Democrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%), and the Free Democrats (10%).</seg>
<seg id="13">The Evolution of the “Alternative”</seg>
<seg id="14">The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 out of the “Electoral Alternative 2013” group, which had taken in former members of the Christian Democratic Union.</seg>
<seg id="15">The group initially arose in opposition to government policy, but early on it handled only economic issues, including problems with the euro and interactions within the EU.</seg>
<seg id="16">The group spoke out against Germany “subsidizing” weak EU economies, and didn’t exclude the possibility of reimbursing Germany and of a full exit from the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="17">As the immigration crisis deepened, the AfD’s platform expanded.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2013 the group became a full-fledged political party, which occupied the Eurosceptic niche and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of its immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, getting 94 seats (out of 709).</seg>
<seg id="20">Two representatives of Alternative for Germany received seats in the European Parliament.</seg>

<seg id="3">The company Roshel Defence Solutions announced that it is already receiving orders for its armored car.</seg>
<seg id="4">Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse</seg>
<seg id="5">The theme of the apocalypse is not just profitable for video game makers, film studios, and book publishers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now automobile companies are mastering this niche, which is new to them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions came out with its armored car for the apocalypse, the Senator APC.</seg>
<seg id="8">In their time spent not pursuing dreams, the engineers of this company make armored cars for the police.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are contained in a fully welded armored capsule that lacks special comforts, but is completely secure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This bunker (it could not be called anything else, since its armor level satisfies the B7 standard) is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenade explosions and anti-personnel landmines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse</seg>
<seg id="13">In order that passengers not be harmed even by the blast wave of an explosive detonated near the automobile, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing chairs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Furthermore, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.</seg>
<seg id="15">For safe vision, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with an omnidirectional camera system, including nightvision, as well as an armored lookout tower on the roof.</seg>
<seg id="16">The automobile does not have any weapons.</seg>
<seg id="17">The front portion of the interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse</seg>
<seg id="18">In order that the weight of the armored car not reduce its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower durable turbo-diesel 6.7 liter motor, the entire power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Roshel Senator APC simply has no chance of getting stuck</seg>
<seg id="20">The Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse, may be seen at a special exhibition in Washington in October.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Universe will exist for approximately 140 billion more years, which is 10 times more than the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Research of an international collective of scientists was published in a library of electronic preprints and sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.</seg>
<seg id="4">Experts arrived at similar conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope to observe about ten million galaxies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Cold Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be a little slower than previously thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">A press release from the Observatory Subaru notes that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of data from the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three years earlier their colleagues presented new conclusions supporting the view that the observed world will end its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Rip.</seg>

<seg id="2">The opportunity to elicit the public's opinion about pension reform has been postponed indefinitely</seg>
<seg id="3">A meeting of the nationwide initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Representatives of 13 subgroups took part in the meeting, putting forward proposals for the wording of questions (in total, the CEC registered five questions).</seg>
<seg id="5">They decided to apply to the Central Electoral Commission to register a single initiative group and ask the public the question: "Are you in favor of the pension age, as established by legislation as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens gain the right to an old-age pension, not being increased?"</seg>
<seg id="6">This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally most succinct.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the meeting participants were supporters of the Fair Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).</seg>
<seg id="8">They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their agreement to take part.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (the wording of her question was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to take part: "It was not clear who our friend was and who our enemy".</seg>

<seg id="1">In the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's errors rained down fast and furious</seg>
<seg id="2">Former all-union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship between Lokomotiv and Akhmat and assessed the controversial incidents of the game.</seg>
<seg id="3">"How would you assess Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat?"</seg>
<seg id="4">"I believe that the referee confirmed that he is not suitable for refereeing matches in the Russian Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="5">It surprises me that with the mess in the fifth round game between Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclusions about his lack of abilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors in his performance and missed calls on bad tackles rained down fast and furious.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed over Akhmata defender Rodolfo in his own penalty area.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just eight meters from the goal line, but Turbin did not call a penalty".</seg>
<seg id="9">"How would you assess the incident with the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to handle the ball?"</seg>
<seg id="10">"I believe the defender deliberately handled the ball in his own penalty area.</seg>
<seg id="11">Turbin was close to the incident, had a good view of it, and his assistant was to the right.</seg>
<seg id="12">This incident should have been seen by the fourth official Sergey Karasev.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, none of the three referees did not see it, and no penalty was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, the score was corrupted, and any sporting justice was ripped up.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was a case in which refereeing by the rules was ousted and the sporting spirit of the game buried".</seg>
<seg id="16">"In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to send off defender Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a duel with Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he defiantly applauded him.</seg>
<seg id="17">What do you think of this incident?</seg>
<seg id="18">Was it necessary to brandish the second yellow card?"</seg>
<seg id="19">"In this incident Turbin brandished the first yellow card in somewhat spurious circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="20">A second would have been logic".</seg>
<seg id="21">"Oleg Ivanov talked after the match about refereeing double standards in that some teams are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in the incident with Idowu, and others are not.</seg>
<seg id="22">How would you assess the player's words?"</seg>
<seg id="23">"It depends on how you interpret double standards.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="25">But it wasn't given.</seg>
<seg id="26">So the referee did not give a second penalty in the opposition goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">That was the principle applied here.</seg>
<seg id="28">And the second incident with double standards is that the referee looks at who is playing.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhmat played, and there have been serious complaints about Turbin's performance, because the team was put at a disadvantage".</seg>

<seg id="2">The United States could begin a naval blockade of Russia in order to obtain an advantage on the global energy market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US government is so eager to fight for success on the global hydrocarbon market that it is prepared to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of fuels.</seg>
<seg id="4">US Department of the Interior head Ryan Zinke spoke yesterday of the possibility of a naval blockade.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unlike other similarly named government agencies around the world, the department conducts not police functions, but civilian ones, and this includes carrying out policy in the area of natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="6">For this reason, Zinke’s announcement falls entirely within his sphere of responsibility, though not without political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="7">Appearing at an industrial event in Pittsburg, Zinke stated that with its naval forces the US controls shipping lanes in the Middle East and could block them if the need arose.</seg>
<seg id="8">Zinke’s words could lead to the conclusion that the need may be tied to Washington’s desire to interfere with Russian deliveries on the global energy market.</seg>
<seg id="9">Zinke mentioned that Russia still received the lion’s share of its income from world oil and gas deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said he is sure that a desire to distribute energy shipments in the Middle East as well as Eastern Europe was the prime motive for Moscow’s expansion in this region.</seg>
<seg id="11">The agency head made it clear that the US is still considering maintaining its leadership on the global energy market, now that it has become the largest supplier of oil and gas.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, Washington will have to put confine Russia and Iran, and Zinke considers a naval blockade of commercial routes to be an acceptable means to this end.</seg>

<seg id="2">Our fellow Russian and Gogol Center actor Yevgeny Sangadzhiev together with his film "Harmony" received a special mention from members of the jury of the Sixth Annual "Dvizhenie" Festival of Debut Films, which was held in Omsk.</seg>
<seg id="3">The awarded festival certificate stated that "this is a signal that will earn an immediate response from large players in the film industry."</seg>
<seg id="4">As many will know, the picture by the young Kalmyk director was presented as part of the "Movement. The Beginning" program of short films, in which eight films were entered.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main prize in this competition program went to the picture “Yana, or Anya Written Backwards”, which was the directorial debut of actress Yana Gladkikh.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Dvizhenie" National Film Festival of Debut Films focuses on youth cinema. However, this is not to be understood as a reference to the age of the producers, but to their inner spiritual state and their desire and willingness to take risks.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a graduate of the Elista Art School named after P. Chonkushov and the Russian Institute of Theatre Arts - GITIS, Yevgeny Sangadzhiev meets all these requirements.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is young, talented, and creative, and in his work he strives to attain new non-standard forms of self-expression.</seg>

<seg id="2">Production of supersonic passenger planes will start in Russia from 2030.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was reported by Kirill Sypalo, the CEO of the Zhukovskiy Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to him, the academic centre is working on supersonic issues both as a part of international consortiums and as a partner of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.</seg>
<seg id="5">“We estimate that we need 3 or 4 years, to build a working prototype of this technology, and 10 to 15 years, to get production line models that would allow us to transport passengers across huge spaces of our country", - added Sypalo.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that Russian researchers now face the task of making the technology economically feasible and safe at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning of September, the aviation engineering company Tupolev PJSC claimed that it completed the predevelopment analysis of passenger supersonic plain. They estimate that the plain will be able to develop speed up to 1900 km/h at the height of 11 km.</seg>

<seg id="2">When a man brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop located in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker offered only USD 50 for the old and flimsy-looking instrument.</seg>
<seg id="3">But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermmitt, suspected that it was in fact an old and expensive instrument, and he decided to consult with an expert for an appraisal.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was then discovered that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gagliano and is estimated to be worth USD 250,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bows alone for such violins are valued at USD 16,000–18,000.</seg>
<seg id="6">An investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was then returned to its rightful owner.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not yet known how the person who sold the violin to the pawnshop obtained the instrument, but it is known that the seller had no criminal background.</seg>
<seg id="8">The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to them.</seg>

<seg id="2">The fact that the clubs currently have an equal number of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind Zenit (which has a distant lead) and only one point ahead of Dynamo, makes this match particularly significant.</seg>
<seg id="3">The red-and-whites are going through a rough patch: the club is again plagued by idiotic scandals. Massimo Carrera's team also unexpectedly took a beating at the hands of SK Rapid Wien in the UEFA Europa League, and they recently lost to Akhmat Grozny at home.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the match with CSKA Moscow, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak was able to beat Chornomorets Odesa with a minimum score and not without some difficulty in the championship. It is still too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia has managed its way out of its crisis.</seg>
<seg id="5">For three games in a row Rostov has not been able to win, but it has gone undefeated now for five matches.</seg>
<seg id="6">Let's see whether Karpin will be able to extend his team's winning streak by winning such a key match that they cannot afford to lose.</seg>
<seg id="7">The previous meeting between Karpin's Rostov and Spartak ended in victory for the capital team.</seg>

<seg id="2">Meteorologists have observed over 170 aftershocks in Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred several days ago, accompanied by a three-meter tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="3">Measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale, the earthquake mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, according to the channel "Russia 24".</seg>
<seg id="4">Over 420 people perished, and over 500 were injured.</seg>
<seg id="5">Authorities had previously warned the population about the threat of a tsunami, but later rescinded the warning.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fact is that sensors did not detect the approaching wave.</seg>
<seg id="7">At this time, the fate of dozens of residents, who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday in the coastal city of Palu, the city most damaged by the elements, remains unknown.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russians and Germans have different mentality but these differences don’t prevent them from understanding each other.</seg>
<seg id="3">Berbel Sakse, a professional simultaneous interpreter, related this on the International Day of the Translator on September 30.</seg>
<seg id="4">Berbel Saks is engaged more than 30 years in the translations from the Russian and English languages.</seg>
<seg id="5">Germans like to plan quietly events, and Russians, as they say in a proverb, "long harness and quickly go".</seg>
<seg id="6">But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between the people and for work of the translator it doesn't play a major role,” she said in the interview to RIA Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the interpreter, “it is enough to know history” to understand that the countries can’t do without each other</seg>
<seg id="8">In the future, Sakse noted, there’s np sense for Germany to ignore Russia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Russia is a natural part of Europe, there’s no sense in ignoring it.</seg>
<seg id="10">We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that define our common destiny,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day before the German chancellor Angela Merkel claimed that the country tries to “start relationships” with Russia and sustain them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Especially important, she said, it the Nord Stream - 2 project constructed from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic sea.</seg>

<seg id="1">The comedy Night School topped the American box office.</seg>
<seg id="2">The comedy Night School, which debuted last Friday at American movie theaters, earned $28 million on its first weekend in distribution.</seg>
<seg id="3">This success allowed the unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office for 28-30 September.</seg>
<seg id="4">Released so far in only 20 countries, the film brought in $5.5 million, including $2 million from British viewers.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its fight for first place, what’s remarkable is that this creation of Malcolm Lee pretty clearly got ahead of another newcomer in western distribution, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious story of a charming yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whose existence the starring character had never believed in.</seg>
<seg id="6">This project of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million on its kickoff weekend, basically justifying the expectations of experts who had predicted $20-25 million for the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regarding Smallfoot’s total box-office receipts, at the moment they amount to $38.6 million (while it has debuted already in 50 countries): Its most active market was Mexico, filling the coffers with $3.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">The top three at the time was completed with the children’s tale “The House with a Clock in Its Walls,” from horror master Eli Roth. This proves conclusively that the director can produce quality movies for the 12+ audience too.</seg>
<seg id="9">For its second week in distribution, the screen adaptation of John Bellairs’ book with the charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing total global receipts to $53.8 million.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of its departure from the top 3, the thriller A Simple Favor, with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, continues to be an incredible surprise: The movie was not realistically expected to perform well financially, but during 17 days in distribution in America this movie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October). And right now it actually has $62.9 million in total sales.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last of the top five this week was the horror show The Nun, which raked in $5.4 million in the reporting period.</seg>
<seg id="12">During 24 days in American (and of course other) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjuring has total earnings of $330 million and now proudly bears the title of most successful franchise movie. The franchise also includes the two parts of The Conjuring and the two films about the terrifying doll Annabelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">The results of the past weekend show that right after this Corin Hardy horror movie comes one more from that genre, the newly-appeared Hell Fest, which is one of the major youth horrors of the year.</seg>
<seg id="14">On its first weekend the movie earned $5.1 million in the US. It is the brainchild of the famous film editor and now director Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a set of big horror projects including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest in some parts strongly resembles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The result is extremely positive when compared to the film’s modest budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">The seventh was Crazy Rich Asians ($4.15 million), which seems unlikely to fall out of the American box office top 10. The romantic comedy has now been on screen for seven weeks, and for September it’s the sixth-highest-grossing film of the genre in history, with $165.7 million.</seg>
<seg id="17">That’s exactly the amount the movie has earned so far on the domestic market; its total revenue is now $218.8 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The last three of the US top ten by revenue for 28-30 September were The Predator, White Boy Rick, and Peppermint — last weekend they earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="19">We’ll add that next weekend in the US, the long-awaited Venom with Tom Hardy will be in full swing. It will without a doubt take over the leading position in the American box office on the first weekends of October.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of the other premieres of the coming week, the musical drama A Star Is Born deserves special mention. This movie by Bradley Cooper won at the Venice Film Festival. And also the crime drama The Hate U Give.</seg>

<seg id="1">"This is ugly nepotism"</seg>
<seg id="2">The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"</seg>
<seg id="3">The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen sham".</seg>
<seg id="4">When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolay Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.</seg>
<seg id="5">But filial feelings took over, and he picked a relative for his team.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.</seg>
<seg id="8">And now the viewers are not ready to forgive Agutin for such an injustice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yesterday we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by nepotism by the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives onto the final ladder.</seg>
<seg id="10">I even doubted that Agutin had the stamina and sense of conscience to not drag his dad to the end all the way to first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Person from the TV".</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "ejected" wonderful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father in the show.</seg>
<seg id="12">But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case; the viewers want an objective assessment and to see genuinely talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I sympathize with the participants of "Voice" from the Agutin team - they were doomed".</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last time, Agutin showed how he loves his dad, but today he had to prove himself as a professional".</seg>
<seg id="15">"The competition has lost its meaning".</seg>
<seg id="16">"Remove two talented people from the project and leave your father in the project who does not sing but whispers, how do you call a mentor after this?",</seg>
<seg id="17">"You like how your dad sings, then organize a concert in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to this concert".</seg>
<seg id="18">This is the show "Voice", and not the show "Big Shot Relatives".</seg>
<seg id="19">"On the part of Agutin, this was unprofessional".</seg>
<seg id="20">"Then you have to offer dad to perform on your own show, and not on a show that is made with the money of Channel 1".</seg>
<seg id="21">"This was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.</seg>
<seg id="22">And I don’t understand why the voiceless dad should evoke a greater appreciation than any other participant with real vocal skills.</seg>
<seg id="23">Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre ejected, and Agutin's father brought to the finals?</seg>
<seg id="24">And then we all complain that for decades there are the same faces on the stage and on the screens!</seg>
<seg id="25">Yes, because you cannot break through nepotism!"</seg>
<seg id="26">"What did you expect?</seg>
<seg id="27">This is Russia!</seg>
<seg id="28">Cronyism and nepotism everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the money in the family budget will come in handy!</seg>
<seg id="30">The theater of the absurd continues!"</seg>
<seg id="31">The users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice", the son of Gradsky took part in blind auditions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then in no way did it occur to the mentor to take his son into his own team.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear".</seg>
<seg id="34">Agutin could not act like a professional.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to him, the scientific community is now developing directions for such activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There is no consolidated opinion yet", - the scientist emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="5">He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would help to avoid interference that originates from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to research cosmic sources of radio waves", - Petrukovich added.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, to use local resources for construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, cosmonauts should be engaged in the search for primitive organic matter on the Earth’s satellite, the scientist believes.</seg>
<seg id="9">This could help us work out how life comes into being on planets.</seg>

<seg id="2">Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, harbored a grudge against the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour convenience store: in May Simms was ejected from the store by the manager for inappropriate behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">So Simms decided to get back at his enemy in an original way.</seg>
<seg id="4">At half past one in the morning, he entered the store and dumped the contents of the basket that he brought with him partly on the floor as well as partly on the products on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby porta toilet.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police who arrived at the scene of the incident arrested the "avenger."</seg>
<seg id="7">He was booked into jail and was released by posting bail of USD 300 pending trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was charged with unlawful trespassing onto another person's property and a criminal offense, and he was also forbidden to enter the store again or to approach the manager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Simms's crime seems more ridiculous than serious, his court sentence could be quite harsh, since he is a repeat offender: he has been charged with grand larceny, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, drunk driving, and animal abuse.</seg>

<seg id="3">Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin from Russia commented on the result of the Grand Prix of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">"To be honest, I don't really want to say what is on my mind.</seg>
<seg id="5">I had a good start, but in the second turn I got caught between two cars which immediately sandwiched me.</seg>
<seg id="6">I instantly lost all the gains that I had made at the start.</seg>
<seg id="7">I ended up in a really bad position.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was stuck in traffic.</seg>
<seg id="9">We hoped that after the others took a pit stop, there would be clean air and the pace would step back up, but the tires were worn out.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also fought with his partner, with whom he also made contact.</seg>
<seg id="11">As I understand, he made a few mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="12">We ended up in such a situation on the track which is the hardest of all to overtake on, I could not do anything, and it was very difficult to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="13">I do not want to talk about it anymore", said Sirotkin to RIA Novosti.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tarpishev said the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the starting lineup of Spartak was absurd</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishev commented on the removal of soccer players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko on Moscow’s Spartak team from training with the starting lineup after a “like” on a criticism of the team’s head trainer Massimo Carrera, says Sport Weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">To pay attention to things like that is utter stupidity.</seg>
<seg id="5">I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.</seg>
<seg id="6">It only deepens the discord on the team.</seg>
<seg id="7">And first of all, it was just poems. You can interpret them any way you like.</seg>
<seg id="8">If I were in Carrera’s place I wouldn’t have reacted at all.</seg>
<seg id="9">After all, everyone has their own opinion.</seg>
<seg id="10">And second, everybody wants to brag.</seg>
<seg id="11">If Glushakov and Eshchenko post “likes,” that doesn’t mean they have something against the trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">I think that Italian isn’t flexible enough in his perception of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">And that doesn’t help create a positive atmosphere on the team.</seg>
<seg id="14">Spartak doesn’t have a game today, so there’s no reason to blow this whole thing out of proportion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe he should have just laughed with them about it.</seg>
<seg id="16">There’s a lot about Spartak that isn’t right. They haven’t gotten their act together after the younger players came on the team.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Judging from all of this,” Tarpishev is sure that “this isn’t boosting optimism before the game.”</seg>
<seg id="18">The two teams will play on 30 September starting at 7:00pm Moscow time.</seg>
<seg id="19">John Terry, fired earlier from Spartak, led the young Chelsea team.</seg>

<seg id="1">The “Sirius” students discussed nature-like technologies with researchers</seg>
<seg id="2">The students of the education centre “Sirius” in Sochi, participating in the School of agrobiology and plants genetics, visited a lecture of National research centre “Kurchatov institute”.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lecture was a part of Global international forum of convergent and nature-like technologies organised inSochi at the instruction of the Russian president Vladimir Putin, says the education centre’s site on September 29.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lecture was opened with a documentary “Kurchatov’s codes”, in which the institute’s president member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk told about global challenges that drive the development of civilisation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lecture was published on the “Sirius” site.</seg>
<seg id="6">The school students learned that modern technologies need a lot of energy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Alternative sources can’t produce this amount of energy yet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nature-like technologies that are being developed by the young scientists, will solve this problem, say the forum’s organisers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Apart from this Kovalchuk talked about risks and responsibility when developing nature-like technologies.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The advent of such technology is a unique phenomenon and a huge benefit.</seg>
<seg id="11">They mean an explosion in medical technologies, improvement of the life quality and infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there is another side.</seg>
<seg id="13">Development of nature-like technologies is in fact reproducing the live nature’s systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another side - it is an intended interference in the man’s life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Risks are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="16">When a car appeared, people started dying under its wheels.</seg>
<seg id="17">But we still use cars.</seg>
<seg id="18">All technologies are double-sided.</seg>
<seg id="19">When I am creating a medical technology, I may be at the same time creating a weapon of mass destruction, said the scientist cited by REN TV.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the film screening and discussion about the recent scientific achievements, the students asked questions to the participants of the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="21">The speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, head of Kurchatov complex of nature-like technologies Yulia Dyakova and the head of Nano- Bio- Info- Cognitive and Social sciences and technologies (NBICS) complex of Kurchatov institute Vyacheslav Demin.</seg>
<seg id="22">The education centre “Sirius” in Sochi was created by the education foundation “Talant and success” on the basis of the Olympics infrastructure at the instruction of president Vladimir Putin.</seg>
<seg id="23">The centre is aimed at discovery, development and professional support of gifted children.</seg>
<seg id="24">Earlier in September it was reported that the winners of all-Russia online competition on information safety “Cyberchallenge” will be granted a chance to study in “Sirius”.</seg>

<seg id="2">The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to "Northern Macedonia".</seg>
<seg id="3">Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of its historical province.</seg>
<seg id="4">The renaming offered prospects for the former Yugoslav Republic to open a way to NATO and later the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">But, as the EFE agency reports, the just 34% turnout at the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, since the referendum was only advisory in nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to reject the renaming.</seg>
<seg id="7">Speaking soon after the closure of the polling stations, the prime minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if among the votes cast there are more "yes" votes, then Macedonia will change its name, despite the quorum not reached.</seg>

<seg id="1">Residents of Kemerovo outraged by flock of sheep in cemetery</seg>
<seg id="2">On September 30, a message was posted on a frequented social network page devoted to Kemerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock freely roam one of the local cemeteries.</seg>
<seg id="3">A fairly large sized herd of animals has been browsing between the fences and are eating the grass.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commentators expressed various opinions: some local residents noted that a few livestock in the small cemetery causes no harm to anyone, and their appetite could even help clear the area of weeds and mow the grass. Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not enamored of the animals.</seg>
<seg id="5">One outraged resident of Kemerovo posted (style preserved): "This is a burial place, not a pasture.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sheep have no business being there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, you can't say that the sheep are commiting an act of blasphemy, but that's not the point."</seg>
<seg id="8">In any event, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of the presence of the animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Davlet’ (to exert pressure) or 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which is correct?</seg>
<seg id="2">The word 'davlet' does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="3">'Dovlet' is correct.</seg>
<seg id="4">The word "davlet" with the meaning of "draw towards, exert influence, an impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "dovlet".</seg>
<seg id="5">We use this word believing that it comes from the word for pressure ('davlenie').</seg>
<seg id="6">But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not only not close and are even in some sense opposed in meaning.</seg>
<seg id="7">Have a think about that for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="8">'Dovlet' (to loom over) (liturgical, literary, obsolete) means "quite, complete, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".</seg>
<seg id="9">It is related to the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).</seg>
<seg id="10">Previously, it also had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to be self-contained" - "to prevail over oneself".</seg>
<seg id="11">The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin to the words "command" and "will".</seg>
<seg id="12">"Davit" (to crush), "podavlyat" (to suppress) are completely different.</seg>
<seg id="13">These words have genuinely creepy "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to oppress".</seg>
<seg id="14">The similar phonetic appearance of the words "davlenie" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to loom over"), as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to contaminate one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">So we had this very "d[a]vlet’", which is also used in writing with an "a", which, really, is incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the origin and development of these words.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, it's correct to write "dovlet" ("to loom over").</seg>
<seg id="17">But this word is obsolete and in its correct meaning it is no longer used.</seg>
<seg id="18">If you want to note that any circumstances/people exert a negative impact on you from above, use the word "davit" ("to oppress").</seg>
<seg id="19">You can also use the construction "exert pressure", but remember that this sounds bureaucratic.</seg>

<seg id="2">Miracles are always happening in our life!</seg>
<seg id="3">The German journalist Christie Dietz discussed one of them on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="4">She wrote on her page that her four-year old son parked his balance bike (children's bicycle without pedals) on the same lamppost all year.</seg>
<seg id="5">One morning, a small sticker appeared on the lamppost with a photograph of the green bike and the inscription: "Only".</seg>
<seg id="6">The delight of mother and child was boundless.</seg>
<seg id="7">Christie thanked the anonymous benefactor and praised him for his interesting and fresh idea.</seg>
<seg id="8">Her tweet quickly spread through social networks and made many people smile.</seg>
<seg id="9">Comments to it were also remarkable:</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is miraculous!"</seg>
<seg id="11">"Thank you for beautiful communication in this world."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I think there are few people in the world capable of such an act."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Unfortunately, they do not draw the same attention as the mischief of scoundrels."</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is the world that we need!"</seg>
<seg id="15">Readers asked the journalist to tell them if she ever manages to find out who had the idea to put the sticker there.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of course the culprit, by all appearances, must have been somewhere nearby: he saw the boy park his bicycle more than once before the idea occurred to him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia protected itself from terrorists with its operation in Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">After three years of Russian military operations in Syria, approximately 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 were killed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was discussed in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former commander in chief of the Aerospace Forces, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defence and Security Viktor Bondarev.</seg>
<seg id="4">He noted the high accuracy of airborne weaponry: Aerospace Forces have precisely struck and continue to precisely strike all their terrorist targets.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Bondarev's words, after three years in Syria tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed - including, for example, ammunition stockpiles, fortifications, and headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russian airstrikes broke the jihadists' defences - this was a decisive investment in the advance of Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.</seg>
<seg id="7">In this regard, in the words of Bondarev, the operation of our forces in Syria allowed the protection of Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the start of the operation in Syria over two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IS, prohibited in Russia) and "Jabhat al-Nusra" (prohibited in Russia).</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the data of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, four thousand IS fighters are Russian citizens and around five thousand are citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.</seg>
<seg id="10">This figure refers only to those people who have been identified, and does not taken into account those who were not identified, Bondarev emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="11">The majority of them were trained and prepared to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, remarked Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights international terrorism abroad - otherwise this evil would "spill over onto us."</seg>

<seg id="1">Vicar of Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra calls for protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines</seg>
<seg id="2">The Vicar of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The text of his appeal to followers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the metropolitan noted, "Christians have been called upon to confess their faith and protect their shrines at different times in the history of our predecessors and spiritual brethren.</seg>
<seg id="5">In light of the situation that has developed, and based on the information that we have obtained as well as the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we are being called on to live through a period of adversity as well.”</seg>
<seg id="6">He called for prayers and other forms of moral support.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, the vicar of the Lavra emphasized that "your physical presence will also likely be required."</seg>
<seg id="8">The priest added: "Lenin's spiritual grandchildren are threatening reprisals, and therefore we need to defend our shrines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The message states: "As people who care about the fate of the Pochayiv Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian shrine and holy place of worldwide significance, we must be ready to defend it."</seg>
<seg id="10">The Metropolitan urged his followers not to be taken in by those who mislead believers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The vicar continued, "The UOC has canonical status, as was determined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990, that was issued by the Mother Church.</seg>
<seg id="12">And now someone wants to make us dependent on the newly styled Patriarch Bartholomew, who is a friend of the Roman Catholic pope.</seg>
<seg id="13">This new style with the consequences that it entails is unacceptable to us Orthodox.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are pleased with the status that our church already has."</seg>
<seg id="15">He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent as well as completely administratively independent:</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is in no way administratively or financially accountable to the Moscow Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="17">In fact, our church already has a tomos.</seg>
<seg id="18">What further Tomos do we need?" The metropolitan of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Vladimir urged believers and all citizens of the country to ask themselves: if other confessions have a Tomos, does that make them independent of the Vatican?</seg>
<seg id="19">The priest emphasized, "Believers have already understood and decided which church they will attend.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, someone wants to sow hostility and discord once again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some are stung with envy of the churches and their shining domes, and they want to destroy them."</seg>
<seg id="22">The Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra is the largest church and monastery complex in western Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="23">The monastery sits atop the Pochayiv hill 70 km from Ternopil.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first historical records of it date to the beginning of the 13th century.</seg>

<seg id="2">Residents of the republic are increasingly visiting the official website of the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the specialists in the department for the organization and monitoring of the deployment of IT infrastructure and information security for the republic-level directorate, more than 140,000 visits to the site were recorded over the past eight months, of which 42,000 were recorded to the "Enforcement Proceedings Database" section, and 661 payment receipts for debt payments were downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Valery Bogdanov, chairman of the Public Council at the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia, practically every citizen in the region owes back debt on utility bills, traffic police fines, bank loans, and other forms of credit, and no one is immune from unforeseen situations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But debtors can expect to face negative consequences in the form of a ban on leaving the country, for example.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is why the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia recommends that everyone who has planned a trip abroad check with their local marshalls service or on the website www.r08fssprus.ru for information about any unpaid debts and pay them off before traveling.</seg>
<seg id="7">The service has created a “Database of Enforcement Proceedings” for the convenience of its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="8">This special electronic application not only can be accessed via the regional websites of the directorates of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia, but also on social networks and mobile devices, including iPads, iPhones, and other smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="9">Delgir Bodgayeva, assistant to the chairman of the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia, explains that the database contains information about enforcement proceedings initiated by Kalmyk police officers against all debtors.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If there are debts, the system displays information about the number of them; the date of initiation of enforcement proceedings; the name of the agency that issued the enforcement order or other certificate; the certificate number, the amount and type of debt; the address of the marshalls service; the full name of the marshall/enforcement officer; and the contact phone number.</seg>
<seg id="11">Information on the status of enforcement proceedings can also be obtained on the state services portal at: http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru"</seg>

<seg id="2">On Sunday, September 30th, in Macedonia, a referendum will take place on the question of an inter-governmental agreement with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Citizens must answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO, making an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the leader of the main opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (IMRO - DPMNU) Christian Mitskosky announced that he would not vote on the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="5">As announced by the party press secretary Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting in order to express their disagreement with the agreement, which he considers "detrimental."</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the press secretary, the current referendum decides the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, since the strategic goal of the party is to achieve NATO and EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week ago, the President of Macedonia George Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="8">He clarified that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader looks negatively on the idea of renaming the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It creates a new semi-sovereign government with a new name," remarked Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="10">The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslavian Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17th of this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, through which runs the border between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">This agreement should decide a disagreement that has lasted for many years over the name of the country, and also mark a step towards NATO and EU membership, reports TASS.</seg>

<seg id="5">"This year set a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of innocent Afghans have died," remarked Patrushev.</seg>
<seg id="6">Afghanistan's troubles began long ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the terrorist attacks of September 11, the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declared to be the USA's chief enemy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not a month passed before America and its NATO allies began Operation Enduring Freedom there.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seventeen years have passed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Several thousand American troops are currently in Afghanistan territory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, peaceful life is even more illusory now than before.</seg>
<seg id="12">American forces have been driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite their efforts, militants are paid off merely not to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Government of Afghanistan controls a minority of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.</seg>
<seg id="15">50% is controlled by the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).</seg>
<seg id="16">Another 10% is controlled by ISIL (prohibited in the Russian Federation).</seg>
<seg id="17">But they are quickly growing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their goal is to create a barbarian pseudocaliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.</seg>
<seg id="19">By all appearances, America is behind this.</seg>
<seg id="20">America is also behind the fact that, after 17 years of its presence in the region, the production of narcotics (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least a factor of 40.</seg>
<seg id="21">The colossal growth in fields sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.</seg>

<seg id="2">An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long-term negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, perceiving that such a name challenged the same Greek province and Greek history.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is gaining the right to a better future and hope for social change.</seg>
<seg id="4">And Greece will secure its right to its past.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are no perfect agreements.</seg>
<seg id="6">They arise as a result of difficult compromises and they cannot make absolutely everyone happy".</seg>
<seg id="7">The ruling social democrats, led by the prime minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">The conservative opposition and the country's president Gjorge Ivanov are against it.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it does not make sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is sufficient to have partnership relations with it: “Many people who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev has been imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this decision will bring about negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, loss of sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clearly there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".</seg>
<seg id="13">Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.</seg>
<seg id="14">The country is at a crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="15">The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole".</seg>
