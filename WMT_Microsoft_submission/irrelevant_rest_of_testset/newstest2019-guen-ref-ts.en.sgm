<seg id="1">Thousands of farmers have gone to the High Court to protest against the dream project bullet train of Gujarat.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Central Government has filed a petition for acquiring the land from the Gujarat farmers for the dream project of the Bullet Train in the High Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the hearing, 1,000 farmers spoke of the affidavit submitted advising that the State Government did not have the right to acquire their land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The bench of the Chief Justice had issued an ultimatum to the Central Government saying that if they did not provide a reply on land acquisition by 26th, the court would release the final order.</seg>
<seg id="5">The High Court is furious about the fact that the Central Government has not complied with the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court in a serious manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next hearing on this will be on September 26th .</seg>
<seg id="7">For the inter-state bullet train project, the High Court slammed the State Government after receiving objections from 1000 farmers of eight districts of Gujarat.</seg>
<seg id="8">“You are misleading the court.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“In your defense, you mentioned that there were only 4-7 farmers who had raised objections against it, but here a large number of farmers had signed the affidavit.”</seg>
<seg id="10">The Farmers’ Advocate Anand Yagnik has argued that the Central Government has not been able to respond even after more than 3 months have passed, even not complying to the JICA company’s guidelines for the most expensive project of Rs. 110,000 crores that belongs to more than one state.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Central Government is attempting not to respond and thus not allowing the High Court to proceed with the case.</seg>
<seg id="12">The collectors are threatening farmers as a last resort because the State Government does not have any strong defense against land acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are being blackmailed to seize the land as per the new conditions.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are being threatened that if the land is not acquired, it will be seized.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Central Government has not presented an answer to the High Court, despite the Supreme Court's order dated 10th August.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result, the farmers will again go to the Supreme Court tomorrow to demand the court order to be complied with.</seg>
<seg id="17">More than 3,000 farmers from eight districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to save their land and inform Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about all the facts about the injustice done by the Central Government to them.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is a provision to cancel the contract if the agreement made by the Central Government with JICA is unfair to the farmers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The farmers will inform JICA about this case. Pursuant to a contract for the bullet train with Japan's JICA company, thousands of crores of loans have been taken for the bullet train.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, Japan has not yet received back installments worth more than 300 crore.</seg>

<seg id="4">Russia's President Vladimir Putin will be signing this agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day India visit.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to allow the S-400 deal, both the nations are taking necessary steps to find a solution regarding the US Dollar as this transaction’s mode of payment.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to sources, India and Russia are looking at the possibility of making the deal in Rupees and Ruble, considering the prospect of a ban from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the time of China's deal, the USA imposed the ban.</seg>
<seg id="8">Significantly, Russia made an S-400 missile deal with China in September.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following this deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose a ban on China.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to this ban, it almost became impossible for China to buy the missile in US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, during the last few years, China had tried to make its currency Yuan an international currency similar to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="12">After this initiative, China is consistently trying globally make the Yuan as an international currency similar to Dollar, also like Euro, Yen and Pound.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of the American Dollar in the international markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">China wishes to make Yuan an international currency.</seg>
<seg id="15">United States can impose CAATSA (Countering American Adventures Through Sections) ban on this $5 billion mega defense deal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last month, the US imposed this ban on China for purchasing S-400 Missile system.</seg>
<seg id="17">India and Russia have already started seeking an alternative solution for this deal since then.</seg>
<seg id="18">Earlier, because of the US ban on the estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia for INS Chakra's repair fared a nuted publicity.</seg>
<seg id="19">Economic analysts opine that to overcome this situation, India should use Rupee-Ruble Exchange as the international currency for this deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Informatively, all of India’s deals with Russia until now have been denominated in Dollars.</seg>
<seg id="21">How did the United States of America’s CAATSA become a good thing?</seg>
<seg id="22">Keeping Russia’s Advanced Defense Missile System in mind, President Donald Trump approved the CAATSA law in August. The US has drafted this law to prevent Russia from working against international interests at the global level.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is understandable that this American law has been prepared considering Russia in view.</seg>
<seg id="24">That includes Russia’s capture of Crimea by attacking Ukraine in 2014, interference in Syrian civil war and interference in 2016 US Presidential elections.</seg>

<seg id="6">The rocks which were of the size of a small car scared the team.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Branson, it was the scariest moment of his life.</seg>

<seg id="15">Nevertheless, this time I had experienced fear for my life.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have never been so scared in my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">The weather was clear and we were climbing uphill.</seg>

<seg id="1">The truth that emerged from the post-mortem reports of the birds.</seg>
<seg id="2">International Desk: Rumours have arisen as many birds are falling unconscious and colliding with window panes in Minnesota, United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some people say that birds have become a prey to black magic, while some have called this as a very rare incident.</seg>
<seg id="4">As there is an increase in such incidents at many places in Minnesota, police started their investigation and solved the mystery behind such incidents.</seg>
<seg id="5">The birds were intoxicated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police had received many complaints about the strange behaviour of the birds and them dropping onto the road.</seg>
<seg id="7">Minnesota’s Gillbert police were upset by getting such calls and started investigating the matter.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gilbert police gathered all the birds that collided with window panes and vehicles and did post-mortem examinations, in which the shocking disclosures were made.</seg>
<seg id="9">These birds were intoxicated when they collided with the windows and vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now the big question for the police was to explain how these birds became intoxicated?</seg>
<seg id="11">Was anyone planning to kill the birds?</seg>
<seg id="12">Or was there any other factor behind it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Birds were getting drunk because of a fruit.</seg>
<seg id="14">Police solved this case with the help of experts.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is told that most of the birds consumed a type of berry (non-fibrous fruit).</seg>
<seg id="16">In England, such berries are called fermented berries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sugar transforms to alcohol by fermentation in such berries.</seg>
<seg id="18">As soon as the birds ate this fruit, they started to become drunk.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result, many birds were observed flying very low.</seg>
<seg id="20">These intoxicated birds became deluded, and were therefore colliding here and there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police provided information as to how to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gilbert police said that it was not possible to stop the birds from eating this fruit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, the people were warned to keep themselves safe.</seg>
<seg id="24">The police says that the windows with more reflection and windscreens can help in preventing them from colliding there.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police informed the people through Facebook that they should not pay attention to any rumour and there is no black magic.</seg>

<seg id="11">Thailand's princess is a Sanskrit scholar</seg>
<seg id="12">She often teaches Sanskrit over there.</seg>
<seg id="13">Enthusiasts from the United States who want to learn Sanskrit have to go to the University of Bonn in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="14">In India, except for the Banaras Hindu University, most of the universities have their Ph.D. of Sanskrit thesis written in the language of the state.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Gujarat,Sanskrit education is given in Gujarati medium itself, but not to forget that in Takshashila and Nalanda Universities, it was taught through Sanskrit medium only.</seg>
<seg id="16">Talking about Sanskrit's influence in Afghan, Prof. Shantha Pandey has stated that not only the native language of the Sultan of Ghazni was Sanskrit, but also she noted that he also minted the coins of his time in Sanskrit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The coins "Mahmood Surtraan" were marked as Quran’s imports in Sanskrit and Pandey noted the creator of Sanskrit grammar, Panini, being a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pandit Nehru in his book "The Discovery of India" has included a long chapter entitled “Vitality and persistence of Sanskrit” mentioned that the Persian language of the Afghans and the Pathans have been derived from Sanskrit</seg>
<seg id="19">At present, it is believed that not only Indian languages, but Indo-European languages are also derived from Sanskrit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another astonishing fact about Dr. Ambedkar's advocay for national language is that the Chief Architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and few other Muslim and South Indian constitutional members proposed to designate Sanskrit as the national language.</seg>
<seg id="21">On 13th September , 1949, at the Constitution assembly meeting, when it was discussed about Hindi over English as a national language, those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language were Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. BV Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed.</seg>
<seg id="22">In view of the discussion of that day and the report published in the "National Herald" on 11 September 1949, it can be estimated that there was a support for Sanskrit language.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, even today we are not able to designate a national language.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are 22 official Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, in our Constitution, but there is no national language.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the census of 2011, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country, which is a very small percentage.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prime Minister Nehru also spoke about Sanskrit in Constitution Assembly meetings with high regards.</seg>
<seg id="27">With respect to the chapter of his book, he was in awe of Sanskrit and told its importance to the scholars of the world: "In 1874, Sir William Jones said," God only knows how old Sanskrit language is, but its formation is wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sanskrit is older than the Greek language, richer than the Latin language and more civilized than both.</seg>
<seg id="29">Nehru also mentions: I do not know when Sanskrit became a dead language but it will be a living language when voted as the people's language.</seg>
<seg id="30">At present, the only use of Sanskrit language is for prayers or as a language for oath-taking by the Ministers of Central Parliament as Smriti Irani did.</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to revive Sanskrit and make it a living and popular language again.</seg>
<seg id="32">If Israel’s dead language can be revived, then Sanskrit can be made alive again.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will only happen if genuine public effort is made instead of just paying lip service or just taking some symbolic action.</seg>
