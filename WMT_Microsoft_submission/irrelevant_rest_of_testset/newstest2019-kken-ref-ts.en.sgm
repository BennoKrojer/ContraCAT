<seg id="1">Gorgeous celebration in all the cities and residential areas of Kazakhstan of the 100th anniversary of bloodthirsty red butchers of Leninist Komsomol is a shame for our country, brothers.</seg>
<seg id="2">This, first of all, means Komsomols' slap in the face of the Independence of the Kazakh Country.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yesterday the information about the great celebration of the 100th anniversary of red butchers trying their best by the initiators, heads of former Komsomol, followers initiated by today's red butchers Nurlan Omarov in Semey, the birthplace of "Alashorda" standing at the origins of Kazakh statehood was released.</seg>
<seg id="4">I was surprised to see pioneers wearing a red tie on the Internet in Kazakhstan schools.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now having seen these Russified, i.e. slaves with no origin started to poison openly the conscious of Kazakh young generation I found nothing to say... What a horror!</seg>
<seg id="6">How can we understand this Komsomol's backtrack from the Independence of Kazakh Country, saying we are Russian slaves?</seg>
<seg id="7">Oh, horror, slave's name is a slave!</seg>
<seg id="8">We need to understand that recognition by those Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanov in fact that they are colonizers' slaves, open expression of their endless love towards Russia is an open recognition of the dependence of today's followers of yesterday red butchers first of all to Russia which we thought to be vanished into thin air up to date.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 1986, I still remember dishonest actions of those current "forever deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aitimova during famous December events in 1986 dished on D.Konayev who helped them raise in their careers to Gennady Kolbin, grieving and crying, now they told about those participating in December events: "Comrade Kolbin, I will bring those bitches you to punish them", and I was the one to write about this grief in my epos "Zobalan" (Outrages), during the Soviet Empire, in particular, in 1990, made one-hour long radio play in Munich, and I am the author of the famous writing traveling the world, akyn Zhumash Kokbori!</seg>
<seg id="10">The Kazakh nation also did not forget who involuntarily quietened down at that time!</seg>
<seg id="11">As the citizen of Independent Kazakhstan, as the child of the Kazakh nation, I will accuse openly the followers of those red butchers!</seg>
<seg id="12">If our country is independent indeed, I will openly talk that the day born to punish them as the state betrayers constituting a threat openly to the Independence of Kazakhstan of forever president of this country as the whole people!</seg>
<seg id="13">"My nation, my Kazakh, my poor people" (Abay), it is the moment to openly punish these red butcher Komsomol as the whole nation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wake up, Kazakhs, history will never forgive your next quiescency.</seg>
<seg id="15">Never forget this, Kazakhs!</seg>
