They should have surrendered when they had the chance !
What ?
Cornelia ...
So this means that the creatures of Area 18 have fallen , right ?
Sorry , I &apos;ll have you accompany me in finishing it . No need . Your section has been secured .
Area 11 will be difficult to handle .
I will find you , Zero ... to avenge Clovis !
I &apos;m home .
Welcome home , Lelouch .
Welcome home , brother .
From the looks of it , you &apos;ve already ate dinner .
I was worried .
I thought that you might have been caught up in the chaos that person named Zero caused .
I called you , but I couldn &apos;t reach you .
Brother ?
C.C.-san came all the way here to see you ...
C.C. ?
Your friend is quite interesting , having only initials for a name .
Yeah ... Could it be ... that she &apos;s your girlfriend ?
Our futures are intertwined with one another , right ?
By future , do you mean marriage ?
No , it &apos;s not like that .
So , um ... she &apos;s kidding ...
I see . I &apos;m surprised at how quickly you decided , brother .
But they say , &quot; To each his own , &quot; so it may not be that strange , I suppose .
Ah , what are you doing C.C. ?
You &apos;re all wet .
Here , you need to go to the bathroom .
I &apos;ll get you a change of clothes too .
Nanali , I &apos;ll clean it up right away , so stay right there .
Also , we were lying before ...
Who are you ?
I told you .
I &apos;m C.C.
That &apos;s not what I mean . You &apos;re ...
Do you like it ?
The power I gave you .
As I thought , you &apos;re ...
Are you unsatisfied ?
No , I &apos;m grateful . You pushed my schedule forward a great deal .
Schedule ?
The plan to destroy Britannia .
I thought that it would be a little while longer before I could make my move .
Do you think you can destroy it with just that power ?
I was planning to do this even without it .
As expected , you &apos;re an interesting person .
What are you going to do from now on ?
You &apos;re being pursued by the military , aren &apos;t you ?
Even if you say the military , it &apos;s only a small portion of it .
It &apos;s enough if I just keep a low profile .
I &apos;ll put up with it here .
Hey , you &apos;re planning on staying here ?
Men sleep on the floor .
That &apos;s not the point ... If I get caught , you &apos;ll have problems too , won &apos;t you ?
Being together is even more dangerous .
If I sleep out there , I will be caught .
Not at your convenience , but at mi-
You &apos;re being very careless about this .
More importantly , how did you survive ?
How is your backbone ?
And that contract you were talking about ...
Fukushima , Kouchi , Hiroshima .
This makes it seven incidences since Zero appeared .
After Zero appeared , other groups apparently became more hard @-@ working .
Because of that &quot; orange &quot; incident , substitute supervisor Jeremiah has lost his leadership .
He doesn &apos;t have the ability to do it .
Thanks to that , the cooperation with the police and unions are in shambles .
It &apos;s quite an inconvenience for us as well .
Lend us your strength , Toudou !
Thanks to Zero , Britannia is in a state of confusion !
Now is the time that we , the Japan Liberation Front , should make a stand !
Don &apos;t rush it ! The information that Kyoto is giving the Crimson Brocade to Zero is not definitive .
If you concentrate on Zero too much , they will pull the rug out from under you !
Hey , in the end , what did &quot; orange &quot; mean ?
What ? You won &apos;t answer anyone &apos;s questions at all , but you &apos;ll ask me questions , huh ?
If you don &apos;t want to answer me , then you don &apos;t have to .
&quot; Orange &quot; was just a casual remark .
But ... There are those who will want it to mean something and will start to analyze it .
The entire world is searching for you .
The entire world is moving because of you .
Lelouch , is this what you wanted to see ?
No , this disturbance is merely part of the calculation .
The world will plunge into an even greater chaos .
Private Kururugi Suzaku of the district 11 military , case 1075 , concerning the suspicion of Prince Clovis &apos; murder .
Why ... all of a sudden ?
Please get out of the way !
Look out !
Um ... are you injured , or something ?
I &apos;m sorry ! I didn &apos;t think there would be anyone below .
Oh ... no ...
I didn &apos;t think that a girl would be falling from above either .
Is ... something wrong ?
Yes !
Eh ? To tell you the truth , I &apos;m being chased by bad people .
So , can you please help me ?
We cannot allow that &quot; orange &quot; to affect Princess Cornelia &apos;s arrival .
At this rate , the loyalty of us , the Purists , will be questioned .
Is that true ?
That Sir Jeremiah is wild ...
At any rate , it &apos;s a fact that Sir Jeremiah is guilty .
Saying that he does not remember anything ... it &apos;s the same excuse as Patre !
Sir Jeremiah &apos;s memories are jumbled .
It &apos;s the same with those who had their Sutherlands stolen in Shinjuku .
I haven &apos;t introduced myself yet , have I ?
Yuffie .
Yuffie ?
Yes .
I am ...
You &apos;re famous .
The son of former Captain Kururugi , Private Kururugi Suzaku .
It was a lie , right ?
The story about being chased by bad people . Meow .
Meow meow ?
Meow meow meow ~
Meow ~
We &apos;re late , I hope he &apos;s waiting for us .
But was he really acquitted ?
Apparently on lack of evidence . Well , it looks like he was thoroughly investigated , thanks to that incident with Zero ...
Oh , why ... ?
Do you dislike cats ?
It appears to be a one @-@ sided love .
Kind people are the ones who have one @-@ sided loves .
It ran off .
Yuffie ? Why did you lie just now ?
Are you concerned about me ?
Eh ?
Uh , yes . Well then , please come with me for a little bit !
When we &apos;re like this , it doesn &apos;t seem too different from being in Britannia .
You &apos;re from the motherland , Yuffie ?
Yes !
I was a student up until last week .
Until last week ?
Then , what are you now ?
By student , do you mean a high @-@ schooler ?
You ask a lot questions , don &apos;t you ?
Oh , sorry . Ah , no , that &apos;s not what I meant ...
Um ... today is my last day off , so I wanted to see what sort of place Area 11 is .
Then it didn &apos;t have to be me ...
No , I &apos;m glad it was you .
Suzaku @-@ san , could you take me to one more place ?
You may request anything of me , princess .
Please show me Shinjuku , Kururugi Suzaku @-@ san .
Lelouch @-@ kun .
Are you busy right now ?
What is it ?
It &apos;s about that phone call from before .
Phone call ?
Um ... you know , that time in the bathroom ...
Ahh .
Do you know if there are call logs ?
I want to contact that person .
It &apos;s the school &apos;s phone , so I don &apos;t think ...
I see ...
I thought so too ...
That woman ...
What ?
What &apos;s wrong- whoa !
No way ...
Hey ...
What are you doing ?
Ah , what indeed ...
To return to the motherland like this ...
I shouldn &apos;t have gotten involved with that woman ...
Are you an idiot ?
Don &apos;t just go wandering around !
I &apos;m okay as long as I &apos;m within the school grounds .
Don &apos;t be so strict .
No , you &apos;re an outsider here .
I &apos;m an outsider no matter where I go .
What &apos;s with that person ?
Oh . So she &apos;s at it again today .
Again today ?
I placed a Geass on her which makes her carve a symbol on this wall every day .
Geass ?
This power .
A test to find out the length of duration , huh ?
It &apos;s best to understand the specs of your weapon , isn &apos;t it ?
If you &apos;re too uncontrollable , then ...
I wonder if it would work on me ?
Don &apos;t worry .
You and I are accomplices .
I won &apos;t do anything that would put us in a disadvantegous situation .
The Shinjuku ghetto is finished .
People had finally begun to return , but ...
Aw ... As I thought , they won &apos;t use the RG &apos;s against Elevens .
Hey , over here .
It &apos;s the aftermath .
Hurry up and take the picture !
I know !
Take a picture of me next ! Me too !
Is that true ?
The information about Zero .
Yes , it is information from Sir Curel .
All right .
Put a cordon on the 4th Zone of the Shinjuku Ghetto .
Understood , Sir .
Sir Curel ... we will leave the rest up to you .
I wanted you to contact Sir Jeremiah , but it seems you probably won &apos;t , isn &apos;t that right ?
Get out of here , you Britannian pigs !
Stay here !
Wh @-@ What ?
You &apos;re just an Eleven !
We &apos;re Japanese !
Don &apos;t call us Elevens !
What are you saying ?
You guys lost to us , you dogs of a defeated country !
Why you Britannian ...
Please stop !
Don &apos;t resort to violence !
Don &apos;t get in the way !
This guy ...
You ... are you Kururugi Suzaku ?
Kururugi , the guy who killed Clovis ?
You idiot !
The one who did it was Zero !
This guy is just a slave .
So what if he &apos;s an honored Britannian ?
Acting so happy ...
Selling your pride , comrades and soul ...
Are you even Japanese ? !
That &apos;s not it ! I ...
That IS it !
You dog of Britannia !
Please stop !
I &apos;m an individual who has received training .
Don &apos;t fight with your comrades anymore ...
What do you mean by comrade ?
Hey !
Let it go .
That traitor ...
Suzaku !
Are you all right ?
Yes .
It &apos;s not okay !
My Prime G and MX 4 are ...
You were too late !
Jeez , for being honored ...
Why did you let them go ?
You should have finished them off !
You &apos;ve killed many Elevens before anyway , haven &apos;t you ?
Who do you think is feeding you ?
I will not allow you to insult this man any further !
In order to use the Geass , one must look directly into the opponents &apos; eyes .
There is no problem penetrating through glasses .
Maximum distance is about 270 meters .
After having the Geass cast on them , or when it &apos;s in effect , there is a noticeable gap in memory .
This is thought to be damage caused by the Geass invading the cerebrum .
If it has the property of light , then reflection is also possible .
You sure have studied it a lot in such a short amount of time .
The opponent is an empire which has subdued over a third of the world .
There is no such thing as exercising too much discretion .
Understandable for Elevens , but you &apos;re Britannian , aren &apos;t you ?
Britannia is much too large and powerful of an opponent to fight with just one Geass .
So everything would be okay if I were strong ?
I wonder if it &apos;s bad to be weak .
At that time ... for us 10 year olds , the world appeared to be a very sad place .
Fear .
Sickness .
Corruption . Decay .
Discrimination .
War and terrorism .
The repeated chain of hatred .
A foolish vicious cycle .
Someone must break this chain asunder .
Quite an idealist .
Of course , I don &apos;t think that it is possible to get rid of all of that .
I &apos;m not that arrogant .
That &apos;s why ... I would at least like a world without war . A place where we won &apos;t lose dear ones .
Such a convenient world ... What can you do to ...
It &apos;s easy .
If someone wins , the fighting will end .
Someone ?
I don &apos;t know yet .
But if I stop aiming for something , my father will have died in vain .
Captain Kururugi &apos;s ... ?
In that war , my father HAD to die !
Jeremiah !
Today , we will make you pay for the sin of allowing the murderer of Prince Clovis to escape !
Cowardly Curel !
So the information that you found Zero was a lie !
Before Princess Cornelia arrives , we must cleanse the shame of our fellow men !
Jeremiah , this is a purge !
Suzaku @-@ kun !
Cecil @-@ san !
It &apos;s dangerous here !
Get on !
The Purists are having an internal conflict .
Let &apos;s hurry up and get out of here .
Oh , and sorry about interrupting your little get together .
You &apos;ll have to do it another time .
Please wait !
Wouldn &apos;t this be a good chance to get battle data on the Lancelot ?
Suzaku ...
Sorry , Yuffie ... we must bid farewell to each other here .
I have to go .
If I have Lancelot , I should be able to stop them .
So !
Dammit ... four on one ...
Cowards !
Don &apos;t worry , Jeremiah .
We &apos;ll treat you like a warrior .
There will be no shame to your family name !
Are you serious ?
Are you seriously going to kill me , Curel ?
! Be silent , &quot; orange &quot; !
Why do you think we exist ?
It &apos;s for the Imperial House , is it not ? !
All hail Britannia !
Please stop !
Don &apos;t fight amongst yourselves as Britannians !
That &apos;s ... the honored Britannian ...
The Collaborative Weapon , Lancelot !
What does a special envoy want ?
If you are going to interfere , we &apos;ll kill you regardless of who you are !
No !
I can &apos;t allow a meaningless fight to go on !
MVS stands for Maser Vibration Swords . MVS ? !
So they were already implemented ...
But , I &apos;m not backing down !
Among your own allies ...
He &apos;s going to save me ?
Kururugi Suzaku is ... ?
Even if I can just take out &quot; orange ... &quot;
Sir Jeremiah !
Is that Viletta ?
Thanks !
Do you still plan on fighting ?
Everyone back off .
Curel ...
So we &apos;ve come to an understanding ?
I &apos;ll use the Chaos Bomb .
Stop !
What ?
That honored Britannian ... Using his own body as a shield ...
Both sides , lower your weapons !
I will command you in my name !
I @-@ It cannot be ...
I am the 3rd Imperial Princess of Britannia , Euphemia le Britannia !
Yuffie ... ?
I will take control of this area .
Stand down !
As I thought ... the Imperial Princess ...
Did you know that , Lloyd @-@ san ?
Yeah .
She rarely appeared to the public because she was a student .
I @-@ I am truly ...
I am truly sorry !
Imperial Princess !
On top of me not even being aware , I have been acting extremely rude to you .
Suzaku ...
Just as you lost your father , I have lost my older brother , Clovis .
Will you lend me your strength so that others can get by without losing their loved ones ?
Yes ! Your kind words are more than I am worthy of !
I heard about it , Euphemia .
Don &apos;t do such reckless things .
I &apos;m sorry , sister . However ...
While we are here , call me Governor @-@ General , Vice @-@ Governor Euphemia .
A distinction is needed precisely because we are true siblings .
Yes , I understand .
Also , concerning the measures being taken ...
Yes , the preparations for the welcoming of the Imperial Princess are being readied in the government office ...
You are lacking . You are weak . You are being sluggish .
What of Zero ?
Capture the enemy of the empire &apos;s people !
Zero !
From today on , I will be a student at Ashford Academy .
I &apos;m Kururugi Suzaku .
Pleased to meet you .
Yeah , I know .
I &apos;m lying .
To Shirley and Rival ...
Even to Suzaku and Nanali .
But ... I can &apos;t go back ... I can &apos;t return .
If C.C. is my accomplice , then I have to use that .
Because I don &apos;t want to lie to myself any longer .
The specially administrated zone of Nippon ...
There are some unpleasant rumors now spreading about Princess Euphemia over this .
right ? That &apos;s where she made contact with Zero .
I think there may be some connection with the top level .
There &apos;s none .
The viceroy wasn &apos;t the only one asking what was going on .
our connections with them must be ... we &apos;ll have to sever ties at once .
Too late .
Vice @-@ Minister .
The profit @-@ sharing bribes from the N.A.C.
I appreciate this .
With this ... we can finally sweep away the parasites who were sucking Prince Clovis dry .
More rats than expected are confused ... aren &apos;t they ?
Over twenty thousand people have applied to join the Nippon special zone .
that number &apos;s just going to grow .
Thanks to you. everyone believes in what we &apos;re doing here .
Princess .
I &apos;m thankful for this .
Truly thankful .
As I am to you .
I hope you &apos;ll help me with everything that &apos;s still to come .
Your ... Please .
Yes .

850 ) } BLOODSTAINED EUPHY
was personally proposed by Her Highness Princess Euphemia .
It cannot be dismissed that this novel idea ... is connected to the princess being a student a short while ago .
then even I have to ... isn &apos;t she ?
Now the terror groups in Area 11 will lose their popular support and fall apart .
Public order will be stabilized .
I personally oppose this .
correct ?
To ensure public policy stays on track .
It &apos;s an obvious measure for a viceroy to take .
Did you accept Euphy &apos;s future from the standpoint of a public official as well ?
The Nippon special zone ... It doesn &apos;t sound that bad .
Will the Japan they hand over have any value ?
This concession came as a result of our resistance activities .
There &apos;s no shame in it .
Master Kirihara !
Did I hear correctly that you were promised a position ... in the special zone involving the Sakuradite mining rights ?
Nothing to be suspicious of .
It &apos;s just a request to participate in the ceremony .
Clever excuse ... How dare you ...
And Zero ?
What about the Black Knights ?
The situation &apos;s serious !
It &apos;s not just supporters . Some of our own members have applied to the special zone !
there &apos;s no risk in joining the Nippon special zone. it &apos;s clear which one is more appealing .
too .
What &apos;s up with that ? !
Probably &apos; cuz they &apos;re offering equality .
Equality my ass !
We can &apos;t just take their word for it !
I agree .
But unless we decide how to respond to this quickly ...
You want to apply to the special zone ?
There it won &apos;t matter who &apos;s Britannian and who &apos;s an Eleven. right ?
can we trust their promises ?
does it ?
that &apos;s ... they &apos;ll force us to disarm .
isn &apos;t it ?
And we &apos;ll get swallowed up in their regime and lose our independence .
we become the enemies of freedom and equality .
Then first we have to support it !
Without any guarantees ?
either !
Sorry about having you drop me off like this .
you helped me stock up on food and I heard you were meeting up with Shirley .
too .
Everyone &apos;s getting panicky about this special zone starting .
soon .
I don &apos;t care about your &quot; special zone ! &quot; I don &apos;t care about &quot; support !
I &apos;d sooner die than sign that !
dear .
It &apos;s Mr. Nobleman .
now ? ! The lower classes should just obey their betters without any back talk !
There it is .
That &apos;s the true nature of the sub @-@ viceroy &apos;s &quot; benevolence .
What do you want ?
doesn &apos;t it ?
student . Back off .
You should be the one who has to go home
you &apos;re right .
I &apos;ll be leaving now .
what did you say ?
Come back at once !
Mr. Nobleman ?
Don &apos;t mistake borrowed power for your own ability !
Garbage like you should just die where no one can ... let &apos;s break this up .
Mister ?
Insolent whelp !
Why should I ? !
Get lost !
Um ... Thank you very much .
it was nothing .
even though he &apos;s Zero !
Or ... Because he &apos;s Zero ?
why was he talking with Princess Euphemia ?
it &apos;ll be dangerous .
as it &apos;s known among the terrorists .
why don &apos;t you break up your group and leave Mt . Fuji ?
we can talk about a legal deal .
your support to the Black Knights will end .
Whether Zero comes or not tomorrow doesn &apos;t matter. that man &apos;s defeat is assured .
I &apos;m home. big brother .
Where &apos;s Shirley ?
either .
huh ? You seem sort of cold towards her lately .
You think so ?
I &apos;ll consider that .
please ?
as you wish .
Are you worried about something ?
Is it about Euphy ?
I won &apos;t be selfish and say I want to see her again .
It would just cause trouble for you and Euphy .
don &apos;t you ?
the same way you like her .
Yeah ...
I did like her .
This is the stadium for the inaugural ceremony for the specially administrated zone of Nippon .
I mean with Japanese .
Many Japanese who could not get inside are gathered outside .
do you think Zero will show up here ?
he &apos;s apparently made no contact at this point in time .
1015 ) } CHINESE FEDERATION EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE CHAMBER
500 ) } E.U. CENTRAL COUNCIL CHAMBER
it &apos;s time .
Right .
Zero .
It &apos;s Zero !
Zero &apos;s appeared !
He came after all !
You accept that you &apos;ve lost ?
What are you planning ?
I thought I would have to carry your identity with me to the grave !
it &apos;s all over !
They &apos;ll mistake this for a farce planned by the Britannians !
It &apos;ll be the end of this specially administrated zone !
kill him at once !
My Lord !
Zero ! Welcome to the specially administrated zone of Nippon !
Euphemia li Britannia !
I sincerely wish to speak with you !
With me ?
Yes ! With you alone !
ladies and gentlemen !
Zero has boldly appeared !
he is moving toward G1 .
I knew we should have gone there .
What choice did we have ?
Zero wouldn &apos;t show .
There doesn &apos;t seem to be any obvious problem .
please .
it &apos;s dangerous to be alone with this man !
At least let me come with you !
just trust me .
how long are we supposed to hang around here ?
Wasn &apos;t having Zero tell us to wait here enough for you ?
but ...
Everything starts after we confirm the Britannian &apos;s real intentions .
Deputy @-@ commander ? Hm ?
Yes ?
hasn &apos;t he ?
It &apos;s dangerous to draw conclusions .
He &apos;s even having Diethard and Rakshata standing by .
I think he may be planning to kill Euphemia ... aren &apos;t you ?
Even though the cameras are off .
I &apos;m afraid .
made from ceramic and bamboo .
It can &apos;t be picked up on a detector .
would you ?
I wouldn &apos;t .
Euphy .
leaving her alone with Zero ?
But she ordered us !
There &apos;s an emergency call button she can press .
What &apos;s wrong ?
What are you doing with Zero ? !
It looks like he can see me .
Is it because of our indirect contact and what happened at Kamine Island ?
then ...
CODE GEASS Lelouch of the Rebellion
This ceremony is being broadcast worldwide .
shoot Zero .
What do you think will happen then ?
I imagine .
Right. and your popularity will crash to the Earth .
What kind of nonsense are you saying ?
Help me rebuild Japan ... you &apos;re being just as bad as Clovis was !
All conditions for this situation have been cleared .
Zero will be cheered when he makes a miraculous recovery .
People don &apos;t care about reason . But they can &apos;t resist a good miracle .
take the gun .
There can be only one messiah .
the people will ...
I ...
I thought so !
Just tell me one thing !
Are you ...
No ...
He &apos;s reached that point ?
What &apos;s wrong ? !
Maj. Kururugi ! you !
What have you done ?
Lelouch !
Stop it ! Stop giving me your pity !
I won &apos;t take your charity !
I have to try and achieve this on my own !
Euphemia li Britannia !
I &apos;ve given up that name ! but I &apos;ve given up my claim to the throne !
is it ?
right ?
isn &apos;t it ? I suppose you did it for my sake .
I see . I did it for Nunnally !
I don &apos;t need anything else .
And that &apos;s why you ?
And that &apos;s what made up my mind .
It made me consider what was truly important to me .
Lelouch ? I &apos;m not giving up anything that &apos;s truly important to me .
And don &apos;t worry !
I won &apos;t tell anyone about you !
And Cornelia ?
It &apos;s not like we &apos;ll never see each other again .
You &apos;re a fool .
An amazing fool .
but ... you ended up winning it all. you were always just plain little Euphy .
Then will you do this with plain little Euphy ?
You ... You are the worst enemy I ever faced .
You win .
Let &apos;s figure out a better use for this special zone of yours .
all right ?
do you ?
Did you really think you could get me to shoot you just by threatening me ?
that &apos;s not it .
no one can resist .
any order at all .
you &apos;re just being silly now .
it wouldn &apos;t matter how you felt about it ...
I don &apos;t ... No !
I don &apos;t want to kill them !
No !
Did I ?
You &apos;re right .
I have to kill the Japanese .
I &apos;ve become like Mao !
I can &apos;t control my Geass now !
Forget the order I just gave you !
wait ! so I &apos;ll be returning to the homeland today .
Then we should keep the experimental adapted organism here ?
Right . How &apos;s his intelligence look ?
There &apos;s only so much we can do here in Area 11 .
I see .
We should ask the Rosenberg Institute about that .
Can you send him and the test unit over there after I make arrangements there ?
Your Highness .
That just leaves the Kamine Island ruins ...
It &apos;ll have to wait till the security situation in Area 11 has stabilized .
We have the specially administrated zone to thank for that .
it looks like everything &apos;s going to work out perfectly .
where &apos;s Zero ?
!
All of you who call yourselves Japanese ... please ?
What did she just say ?
No way ... right ?
He &apos;s just unconscious .
But why ?
Umm ... can you ?
please kill them all .
Wipe them out !
She &apos;s serious ?
Cut the mics and cameras !
no !
Halt !
Out of my way !
Damn terrorist !
Stand aside !
soldiers ! Hurry !
Princess Euphemia !
What &apos;s come over you ? !
please ! This is ...
General !
but I have to kill all the Japanese .
all Britannians !
exterminate the Elevens !
Don &apos;t let one escape !
Kill them all !
Stop it !
What are you doing ?
Knight of Honor of the Britannian Forces !
Cease fire at once !
We were ordered to kill all the Japanese here .
Princess Euphemia ordered it personally .
What ?
Princess Euphemia did ?
Don &apos;t be ridiculous !
aren &apos;t you ?
What &apos;s happening ? ! What happened in there ?
Gun fire ?
It can &apos;t be . What does the TV say ?
They cut the feed !
STOP !
This ... My Geass did this ?
Z
- Zero ...
Help us ... Japan &apos;s ... savior ...
Don &apos;t force me ... too ?
I &apos;m not your savior .
I &apos;m not your messiah !
You &apos;re ... You &apos;re our only ... hope ...
Stop ...
Don &apos;t ...
!
Zero ...
What did you do to Princess Euphemia ? !
Andreas Darlton ...
The closest of Cornelia &apos;s close advisors .
What ?
!
What &apos;s happening in the stadium ?
We &apos;re figuring that out !
We &apos;re getting a feed from the stadium now .
Why can &apos;t you cut this off ?
Someone &apos;s hacking this in from somewhere !
Stop it !
It &apos;s going live to the entire world !
They &apos;ll cut the broadcast soon .
Let &apos;s upload the data to the Net .
You heard him !
Right .
Sir !
C.C. has made contact with the supreme commander !
cleared .
Zero .
I &apos;m shocked . I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d go this far .
It wasn &apos;t me .
What ?
I didn &apos;t use my Geass .
I didn &apos;t mean to use it !
what I felt before was ...
I made my contract with you . You told me how dangerous this power was .
And yet !
He did it ! He really did it !
- What is this ? !
wait !
Don &apos;t follow me unless you &apos;re coming along !
Euphy !
Have you found her ? !
Where is she ?
!
either !
Something &apos;s wrong .
This isn &apos;t like Euphemia at all .
but we can &apos;t be connected with Kirihara now !
we need to save ourselves .
Indeed .
Is the &quot; souvenir &quot; ready ?
How pathetic ... we value ourselves above others .
Lady Sumeragi .
as well .
And what &apos;s the point if we &apos;re the only ones left ?
Kaguya !
You only have your family &apos;s name backing you !
what &apos;s the point of Kyoto &apos;s existence ? !
I can &apos;t believe Euphy would order all those people to be exterminated !
somehow !
Hey ! The Britannian forces have left the stadium !
Right .
our only option is to exploit Euphemia to the utmost .
It &apos;s the least we can do !
Zero ! Return that unit !
That machine is the property of our military ...
This is an order to all Black Knights !
Euphemia has become our enemy !
The specially administrated zone of Nippon is a cowardly trap to lure us in !
break into the ceremony grounds !
Wipe out all Britannian forces !
Save the Japanese !
Hurry !
I have to ! I have to find Euphy ! Find her and kill her !

Who was it that created this situation ?
Who is it that bears the sin for this tragedy ?
Who is it that desires this battle ?
And who is it that the world belongs to ?
I understand .
I !
Look around you .
Everything moves , everything orbits .
It is how we are born .
The Sun , the moon , the planets and the stars watch .
We are at the Centre .
Our place .
But , Nicolaus Copernicus came and said that the Sun stood at the Centre and that we moved around it .
Just like the other planets .
An Earth that moves ?
But can &apos;t we see or feel that ?
That was 1543 .
Galileo made a telescope and pointed it at the sky in 1610 .
He discovered moons around Jupiter and saw how these orbited around the planet in hours and days .
Later Christiaan Huygens and Dominique Cassini discovered moons around planet Saturn .
Everything seemed to orbit something .
Could it be true ?
Johannes Kepler described these movements Isaac Newton caught them .
From apple to planet : everything obeyed his laws .
What about us ?
We became usedto it and knew no better than the Sun stood at the Centre and we orbited around it .
And the stars that we see ?
What about that band of nebulous light , the Milky Way ?
Different cultures had given it different interpretations .
For the Egyptians it was Isis &apos; wheat , the Incas saw it as golden star dust , for the Eskimos it was a band of snow and the Christians thought of it as the road to Rome .
It turned out that the Milky Way is made of stars :
hundreds , thousands millions of stars .
And then We discovered the nebulae .
Some were spiral shaped , other oval or irregular .
Where did they belong to ?
How did everything fit together ?
We , the stars , the Milky Way , the nebulae ?
In the middle of the 19th century we knew that the stars were in fact like the sun .
That they must be very far away .
And that the Sun was very close by
And that was the Universe , a collection of stars
And our place in all that ?
Spiral Galaxy the Milky Way unravelled

In the middle of the 19th century the introduction of photography
Before , astronomers had used visual techniques to map the stars of the northern sky .
Looking through a telescope they had swept the northern sky and catalogued each star , their positions and brightness ,
up to a certain limit .
This catalogue of northern stars was also called a &apos; Durchmusterung &apos; , a German word for survey .
With the introduction of astronomical photography an astronomer at the southern hemisphere said :
&apos;Let us complete the northern catalogue with all the southern stars , using photographic techniques&apos;
This astronomer was David Gill , the director of the Observatory Cape of Good Hope .
I am sitting next to a photographic telescope very similar to the one used by David Gill .
To take photos with the telescope you need to constantly check that it stays pointed at the same part of the sky
You have to compensate for the daily apparent movement of the stars in the sky
So , there is a place where the photographic plate is put , about here .
That is the focal plane of the telescope .
Parallel to it , there is another telescope , here below .
You look through this second telescope with your eye to check that the instrument follows the stars correctly and at the same time an image is taken with the other telescope ,
That could take several minutes or even longer .
When done , the exposed plate had to be changed for an unexposed one and the telescope pointed at a different part of the sky .
And this procedure continued until one had covered the entire sky with photographic plates
em started this big project to photograph the entire southern sky .
But he did not immediately think about measuring all these plates
Around the same time , the astronomer Kapteyn became professor of astronomy in Groningen ( the Netherlands ) .
It was expected that he would get a big telescope , but for unknown reasons this did not happen .
And so Kapteyn thought :
&apos;Well , there must be useful work to be done also without a telescope . &apos;
And the idea was born . That he could collaborate With David Gill from the Cape Observatory to perform that huge task of measuring all the plates Gill had been collecting .
Both astronomers got into contact about this idea and it quickly led to an agreement :
Kapteyn would measure the plates , while Gill continued ro collect new ones .
One can ask whether they realised the size of such an undertaking .
Kapteyn began enthusiastically and it took him several years to finish the work .
It was published in three thick volumes . A copy can be found at the Kapteyn Institute in Groningen .
They contain nothing more than columns of numbers , indicating the positions and brightness of all stars on the plates .
This huge work became known as the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung .
It was this big achievement that lead Kapteyn to first distinguish himself at that time .
But in the meantime , he must surely have thought about other questions in Astronomy .
And one of those questions caught his attention early on : the properties of the ensemble of stars we see in the sky , the Milky Way Galaxy .
At the beginning of the 20th century around 1904 , he made an important discovery in this area .
He noticed that the stars did not move randomly through Space , but that their movements had preferential directions .
Within the astronomical community that was a very important discovery : the fact that there was regularity in something astronomers had always considered to be chaotic !
Thanks to this discovery he established his name even more so , which helped him pursue his plans for further research on the Milky Way Galaxy in collaboration with institutions abroad .
At the end of his working life ,
Kapteyn had constructed an idea about how the big ensemble of stars of which we are part , fits together .
He had found a model that best fitted all the data he had collected overtime :
information about distances and movements of the stars .
We now call this the Kapteyn model .
The Kapteyn model was much like a thick disc .
In the centre part of this disc the stars were densely packed in space .
And towards the edges of the disc the stars were further and further apart .
In terms of size , from the centre towards the edge of the disc was about 30,000 light years ,
meaning that light has to travel 30,000 years to cover that distance .
In the direction perpendicular to the disc the size was much smaller , of the order of 7,000 light years .
So , it &apos;s a model that is quite easy to understand .
And Kapteyn must have felt it as a great satisfaction that he had found a model of which he could say : &apos; This is how things must be . &apos;
Jacobus Kapteyn had found a model for the Universe :
a disc like structure with the Sun near the Centre .
It explained the Milky Way .
But there were other scientists who disagreed with this model .
New observations indicated that the Universe must be much bigger than what Kapteyn had proposed .
A big debate took place in the early 1920s .
It became clear that the spiral nebulae must be very tar away way beyond the borders of the Kapteyn Universe .
Slowly this new vision gained terrain .
And the idea that we were also part of such a flat spiral nebula began to grow
And that the Sun was not at the Centre .
At the end of the 1920s the young astronomer Jan Oort derived the rotation of the Galaxy from movements of the stars in the Sun &apos;s neighbourhood .
It also explained the star streams Kapteyn had discovered at the beginning of the 20th century
But how could we get an impression of the entire Galaxy ?
Large quantities of dust between the stars obscured a clear view to distant parts and the Centre .
For twenty years people searched for a solution .
I studied astronomy and mathematics and physics of course .
In April / March 1943 all students had to sign a declaration of loyalty towards the german occupiers
It you did not want to do that , you had to work in Germany .
Most students did not want that either and they had to hide .
That is more easily said than done , because where to hide ?
At a farm ? But I did not know any farmers .
Or in the North @-@ East Polder , where a lot of students hid .
I was lucky to hide here at this Observatory , together with a fellow student , Hans Hubbenet .
We came here in May 1943 .
We were put in a small room , door locked , curtains closed , and we sat silently all day long .
After 6 p.m. , when the Observatory &apos;s personnel had left , we were allowed to leave the room , but at 8 a.m. we had to be back .
And so we did day after day , and it went fine .
We were still in a scientific environment , so I could not have imagined any better place to hide .
There were a couple of other students as well .
Hans and I were the only ones hidden , but there was another student , three years older than me ,
Henk van de Hulst .
Henk hacl finished his studies , except for the final exam , which he could not do , because the University was closed .
And he had one big advantage : he was an assistant at the Observatory .
So on his ID card was written : Assistant . Wehreas on mine it said :
And the Germans were arresting the students .
But an assistant could be an accountant &apos;s assistant or a pharmacy &apos;s assistant or anything else .
So Henk could move around freely .
Early in 1944 something happened that we found very special .
Henk received an invitation from Prof. Oort , the director of the Leiden Observatory , to come and work with him for a few months .
Today this is quite normal . But at the time , it was like going to a different continent !
