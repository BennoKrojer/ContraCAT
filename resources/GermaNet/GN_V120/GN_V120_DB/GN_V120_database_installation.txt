Setting up the GermaNet 12.0 PostgreSQL Database
================================================

1. Requirements:

- Install PostgreSQL 8.4 or later: http://www.postgresql.org/download/


2. Installation (under Linux/MacOS):

- Open a shell (command line) window

- Before we import the data from the dump file, we must first create the database
  into which the data will be imported. This can be done by executing the command:
    createdb germanet12

- To initiate the import process, run the command:
    psql germanet12 -f GN_V120_database_dump.dump

- To create statistics that optimize the operation of the database, it is
  recommended (but not required) to run the command:
    vacuumdb -z germanet12

- As part of the import process a system user called 'germanet' is created, with
  its password also set to 'germanet' (lower-case). With this user it is possible
  to execute commands on the database tables. For example:
    psql germanet12 -h localhost -U germanet -c "SELECT * FROM lex_unit_table;"
  (Note that this user is not essential to the correct functionality of the system,
  however it is set as the owner of the tables in the germanet12 database.)
